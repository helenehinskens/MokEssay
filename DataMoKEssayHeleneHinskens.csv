2022-01-23 10:38:50	I have been in a sexless relationship for 20 years. Listening to this podcast has encouraged me to take control of my sexuality, leave my marriage, and become involved with someone who cherishes a sexual relationship just as much as I do.

They have an acute ability to help empower you if you're lost to the negatives that sexual trauma brings to your life. 

They help educate you and give you some of the tools needed in order to better yourselves in life and in the bedroom.

Listen, take note and hopefully see some positive changes yourself.

2023-03-14 22:26:35	I’m a 24 year-old cis-female, and I’ve been listening to you guys for 2 years now from Toronto, Canada! <3 The variety of topics you’ve explored on this show has really educated me and has inspired me to approach sexuality in a down-to-earth way. Instead of viewing sex as a performance (the way it’s portrayed in porn and even in Hollywood movies lol), I’m now focused on doing things that make my body feel good and prioritizing communicating with my partner and working together to make each other feel good. Your sense of humour also brightens my day, you guys are hilarious and it’s very appreciated 😂💗 thank you for everything!!	5	cheyenne.tasha	Super helpful

Womp womp (sad trombone) But… after we had some fun time in the bedroom this morning she told me that those were the best touches she’s ever received in our 4 years and that I should definitely keep listening!

2021-10-20 19:30:18	"I have had fun listening to the diverse topics and inclusive approach of “chip and dip,” and I hope more of the world gets to appreciate the normalization and playful encouragement that these girls put out. 

I love the personal stories, including what they are or are not into - sets the stage for healthy boundary discussions, and especially for trying new things, new perspectives, new toys! 

Sex is beautiful, necessary, empowering, fulfilling, and taboo… One of these words does not belong. Pretty sure anyone can figure out which one. This show is helping to remove completely unnecessary and archaic barriers to healthy female and male sexuality. We have enough external problems. Thank you for helping our world deal with the internal ones :)"	5	Ace_mac	This Show Gives Me Hope! Thank you, from a male health provider
2021-11-17 18:46:22	It’s mostly men and women that have sex and might benefit from the advice. But the hosts go to great, awkward lengths to avoid saying words like men or women. That won’t age well but at least they are politically correct… Some episodes are just full-on advertisements with guests that sell sex products and surprise, they recommend their company’s ware when given questions by the hosts.	1	Jaympols	Cringey
2021-09-25 11:46:09	Learning so much on this sex-positive, respectful, fun, informative, not too serious podcast. It has supercharged our sex life and increased how we communicate about everything in the bedroom.	5	JVD1031	Great info and lots of fun!

I felt motivated to come and write you a review after seeing your IG post about bad reviews. I can’t fathom what those people are listening to as clearly, it isn’t you! You bring such love and light to all things sexual. Your product reviews are great and I even purchased a few items you've recommended, well done!! As one who grew up in a quasi puritanical home, I absolutely adore your factual, no nonsense approach to every topic. You are trail blazers at smashing stigma and you are spectacular cheerleaders for all things consensual!!

2020-04-27 03:27:16	"First of all thank you for making a podcast not only entertaining but also informative. I discovered your podcast a few months ago, and wow was I ever clueless before. 

Before listening to your podcast I always believed that sex was just sex, in and out, and bada bing bada boom done. I always felt so unsatisfied since I didn’t get the same pleasure feeling as my partner, or so I thought, and I always felt like it was either my fault or I was supposed to feel that way. 

Needless to say, you two beautiful and inspirational women opened my eyes to what women should really feel with their bodies. It isn’t just about the in and out, it’s about everything in between. I’ve learned so much from you two and about how to explore my sexual self, and how to get my partner to now explore with me. I’ve officially bought my first vibrator (at 27 I may add), learned new things to do in the bedroom to spice things up, and finally started having orgasms and feeling that amazingness that I should of felt years ago! If it wasn’t for you two, I may have never learned any of this, so thank you so much! 

Please continue what you are doing because I can only imagine how many other women and men may be going threw the same thing. You opened my eyes, so THANK YOU!

If I can only make one little suggestion on ideas you can talk about in future episodes, I miss when you two would talk about your lives or in general. It would be really nice to have an episode of two with no guests and just you two. Ohh! And also more bedroom ideas would be fantastic! I wanna spice things up! 

Again, thank you so much. Please don’t stop!"	5	Beamesie	Thank you!!!!!
2020-03-12 20:35:53	"Hi Amy and April!

First of all, thank you for this awesome project, you’re an amazing tandem of knowledge and empowerment!

This podcast gave me opportunity to identify my personal shortcomings and motivated to work on myself and my relationships. I have listened to all episodes, took me about 6 month, and i can clearly see how much it normalized talking about sex related topics, gave me words and ways to express myself and put me on the path of discovering my own sexuality. I am very grateful for this amazing experience that broaden my horizons, helped in fighting shame, stigma and judgement and generally made me a better person!

I have only one question / request: you’re constantly talking about co-erotic themes and it’s very important and fascinating topic, but i feel like i cannot find any information about it. I listened to episode #2 three times, but definitely need more information and guidance in this area. Maybe you can give some literature suggestions or sources that I can go to for this information, or maybe even make another episode about it? 😉

Thank you again for leading this sex revolution, i’m trying to spread the word about this so much needed content! 😘"	5	Tana Sparklegem	It’s much more than sex!
2020-03-11 02:06:00	This podcast came into my life at a time when I was just starting out on what has been a wild and exciting exploration of my sexuality.

Besides learning SO MUCH, and thinking about all sorts of things I wouldn't have before, your delivery is really perfect. I simultaenously feel like I'm sitting in on a super interesting class/ my bestfriends and I are chatting. I introduced the podcast to my partner and he loves it too! He always suggests we listen to ""the girls"" and it always brings up great topics for us to discuss to get deeper into our relationship.

After having an eating disorder my sexuality really got messed up. I didn’t feel like having sex anymore or masturbating and i have masturbated since the age 5. But after founding your podcast i was able to dive into my sexuality again. 

I love you and you are amazing. These girls are so fun and they make awesome episodes with a lot of easy information. I really love their podcast because it is not only about sex. It also has a lot of stuff about self love, nonviolent communication and a lot more. That is why i think enyone can listen to this podcast and get some super good information from it.

Regardless of gender or sexuality, their podcast topics are interesting, original and told with such warmth and openness, listening to this is bound to help anybody improve their confidence, both sexually and in everyday life too. As a young woman still attempting to find her confidence, listening to this every week really has does done wonders for my personal development and I have these two wonderful women and their awesome guests to thank.

2019-02-17 05:14:54	Thank you for this great resource which is helping my wife and I greatly. I would appreciate it if you would ease up a bit on the Margins wine recommendations, these are so long that I usually know I can skip a couple minutes forward without missing anything. I’m not from the US and this is not relevant to me.	5	Ariman88	Thank you Amy and April

One of the first podcasts I ever listened to and I can’t believe how much I’ve learned about my self and loving communication through Amy and April. Can’t wait to grow even more in my sexuality as I follow this journey (and hopefully become truly shameless myself)!
Ps. listening in from Norway 🇳🇴"	5	Ms. S95	Amazing stuff!

He ripped off my clothes and started sucking on my nipples and licking my meow 😍 he shoved his snake into Kitty and made me cream so hard. Then my mom came in and we were all licking each other and white stuff was my meal for that night.	5	AwesomeWOMEN4LIFE	Sexyyyyyy
2023-11-13 12:56:00	"Amy and April,
thank you!!!!!!
Your podcast has changed our lives! My husband and I (hetero-monogamous) will be celebrating 13 years of marriage this New Year’s Eve. We have a wonderful relationship but our sex life was so-so…until I heard about and listened to my first Shameless Sex podcast episode. Oh my! I was very shy about asking for what I wanted and so was my husband (this was one area of our marriage where we didn’t communicate well) I suggested we listen to a Shameless Sex podcast throughout our day and talk about it before bed. I am happy to repost that we now enjoy an enlightened, orgasmic, hot, explosive sex life🔥🔥. Thank you for taking the shame out of sex and making our marriage one to envy😏"	5	SusieC4	“O” my!

2023-09-21 15:12:15	Alicia and Erwan are great. I'm in a long-term relationship and this discussion was well-timed. By definition, I am in a sexless marriage. I love my wife, but intimacy has suffered. Discussions like this are valuable and provide some direction, the rest is up to me (us)	5	EddieOakland	Episode #347 Say Bye to Sexless Marriage
2023-08-27 21:20:48	I am a new listener and I have to say I absolutely love these ladies and various guests that they have on the show!

2023-08-17 16:45:22	As a man it’s so tough to talk to most guys about sex, sadly it’s normal. My wife and I have been on an absolutely insane journey this year and this podcast has been a huge wealth of knowledge and insight that’s helped us get over our ultra fundamental upbringing. Our conversations and communication was great before and now it’s on a whole new level and we can’t stop talking to one another about sex. It’s now hard to not talk to our friends about what we’re learning. One day we hope to do coaching ourselves but not sure where to start there either.	5	Joshua31pitcher	Thank you!!
2023-08-10 17:43:25	So funny, so informative- all around great show!	5	Jojo555877654	Awesome duo

2023-08-07 17:56:15	Love these ladies! I’m of the older generation and still love your podcasts. The speakers that you choose have been very helpful! I have been married to the same wonderful man for just about 35 years. Without giving away too much information, we are still very sexually active and I have learned quite a bit from you and your speakers.  We are trying to up our game and you have helped. 😊	5	Refinedanspach	💕
2023-08-06 18:47:40	I look forward to this Podcast every week. I have learned a ton from it even if the topic is nothing that I’m ever likely to use in my own life. I’m a guy, and while I’ve been married for over 40 years women are still a bit of a mystery to me. This show has helped me to understand so many things about sex from a woman’s perspective just a little bit better.	5	Pinwormdelight	Very, very good
2023-08-04 14:50:30	April and Amy Rock!  Love this podcast.  Worth the time!	5	miamirocker	Great Vibe

2023-06-20 20:14:21	Seems like there is good information buried in here but the singsong voices, constant “inside” jokes, sex jokes and flirting with each other is just too annoying for me.	3	RaTr85	I wish they were less annoying

2023-02-17 12:25:44	This podcast has introduced me to so many new ideas and concepts that I’ve never heard of! After growing up in a household where sex was never discussed, going to a school that taught abstinence, and thinking I was asexual in my teenage years, I’ve only started exploring my sexuality within the last few years. It’s thankfully been such a positive journey, and this podcast has opened up my world even more to all the possibilities and opportunities to further explore and continue to grow in my sexual self. I’m so thankful to have found Amy and April so early into my journey :)	5	victim 14,395	Empowering and Informative

I’ve found myself with my best girlfriends scattered throughout the country which could be depressing, however, I’ve found Shameless Sex. Move a muscle, change a thought. So when I’m down, I’ve been tossing on your podcast and getting outside. I find myself smiling, even laughing on these walks as if I was strolling with a couple friends. I appreciate this podcast more than you know. Ohhh—your hot topics are expanding my mind for the better. ;) Thank you!!!

2023-01-31 13:43:03	I found this podcast and it has quickly become one of my favorites. I love that they have episodes over such a wide variety of topics and they feel like they are being very honest and open about their own personal experiences in each episode. Highly recommend.	5	barista007	Fun and entertaining
2023-02-04 17:36:27	Even though both women are very likable and I support the general message of the show , the more I listen I realize it is basically an infomercial to sell products and other podcasts.  Occasionally when they have a great guest and actually let he/her talk it can be very interesting and informative but most times it’s too much of them and products they are trying to push on people.  Most of which are not very good.	2	69goat69	Advertisement

2023-01-24 18:46:33	This Pod has helped me so much over the 4 -5 years as a relationship ended and I was shamed and blamed. Amy and April along with their knowledgeable guests have really hit home with me about accepting yourself and others around you. Open discussions and honesty with parters is the best path forward. 3 years of separation/divorce from a Narcissist has been so rewarding to be free of so much negativity. In the time since I have a 50/50 custody of my wonderful girls. I have discovered a new lover/partner/soulmate who matches and compliments my every desire.  Before the shameless sex podcast I did not think it was possible to be in a relationship that allowed me to be a devoted father to 5 kids and married to a sex kitten at night.  Relationships are a team sport, and I have found my team.  AH	5	AdamHudson	So much great information, I feel so much better about myself
2023-01-17 05:00:44	I love u guys!!! I am a 20 year old woman from California but nobody has ever ever ever talked to me about any of this, so you guys rock! I have been listening to your podcasts for about three months and literally listen to one episode a day, AT LEAST! Thank u so much for being great also I know u read everyone of these reviews so I finally thought I’d say thanks. Now I am in an honors sexuality discussion class in college because of your podcast. Still struggling with a lot regarding sexuality because I feel like no one at my age is in a educated, sex positive headspace yet! But hopefully I will find  the resources and the right people o hang out with so we young people can all have awesome sex lives	5	rmdrmdrmd1	Best podcast ever

2022-12-30 18:04:00	"Ladies! ladies! You are social healers and I am so grateful to have found your podcast.
Your wisdom, humor, shameless vulnerability and incredible guests are a public service and part of the “solution” our society needs. 
 Originally from Los Gatos, now in LA 20 years, the fact you are in Santa Cruz makes it even more delicious. My husband and I are huge fans.  I drive the trek from SoCal to NorCal to visit family and friends about 6-8x per year and it becomes a 6 hour workshop/course on every topic I could possibly dream up regarding sex, relationships, sexual health and healing wounds from deep seeded social constructs.

Enjoy listening as a recently disabled person who more recently separated from their ex of eight years and most recently declared gender neutrality. Blissings Beloveds. Question: communicating with several pretty women, don’t know if they are interested in me (bad at that). Problem is flowers are pretty. These women do not hold physical attributes I enjoy.

2022-08-31 13:08:18	I think my therapist recommended this podcast and it’s worth it. If you’re uncomfortable with any part of sex these 2 ladies will walk you through and bring you to the comfort zone you’re craving. I love it, keep it up!	5	charrybear	Great podcast!
2022-08-28 03:50:55	Hi I just stared to watch your podcast and I didn’t know there was so much about sex I learn something every time I Liston thanks you so much for your work	5	dnr3301	Big fan
2022-04-25 13:10:01	Listen to very well published shows like Hidden Brain and listen to the sound quality.  It’s clear and bright and flawless.  This show sounds like a garage show audio quality.  The sound is muffled and not sharp.  Other than the sound everything is good.	4	WowWowWeeWoo	Good but audio quality needs work.
2022-08-18 16:07:51	I’m so happy I found this podcast. I’ve always felt very confused about my own pleasure due to trauma and these ladies make me feel safe and have a lot of answers. I feel excited about sex after each episode. Thank you <3	5	DJFembot	Inspiring

2022-06-28 20:52:43	Highly recommend this podcast for sex positive people. The show has great content. Amy, April, and their guests can inform you about most any sex issue. Another plus is the ladies both have a great sense of humor.	5	azsun55	Shameless Sex podcast

2022-06-27 17:58:37	"I grew up in a conservative Christian home in the Bible Belt. My sisters and I only got the birds and the bees talk once FROM OUR DAD around the age of 10. I was sheltered from any and all things sexual. 

As a young adult, I found myself curious about all things sex. This lead me to some not so pleasurable moments that had I been informed and educated, could have been easily avoided. I found that after I got married and had kids, I wasn’t sure of what I really wanted or was into sexually. April and Amy have completely opened my mind in such an amazing, supportive nonjudgmental, shame free way that I am forever grateful. I have learned so much from this podcast. My sex life with my husband has exploded (in the best way possible)! We try new things. We’ve mastered techniques. We talk about difficult things. I truly am a believer in finding your own pleasure and knowing your body and how to communicate your wants and needs to your partner. I’m able to do this now because of April and Amy and this wonderful podcast. 

I am so thankful for the two of you!! Please keep paving the way for all of us sheltered church girls that just want to be educated and find our own pleasure. Keep up the life changing work, ladies!!"	5	Frautumn	Healing my trauma

2022-05-19 03:54:42	"These gals got that juice! Every episode is hand picked and playfully squeezed to give you that powerful, toe curling content you need for mind blowing self-actualization. 

Listen in the car, at the gym, while buying groceries at the store… no one will know that you’re learning how to give the best head ever, conquer past traumas, or master your own erotic energy. …no one but that special partner who’s body and spirit is about to be shook to the core in the best way. 

Thanks Chip and Dip. Keep doing the good work."	5	Volly88	Shamelessly Fabulous
2022-05-12 02:23:55	"Amy and April are the two most adorable creatures within the sex-oriented Podcast world.
Good humor, great interviews, valuable information, positivism and a genuine will to teach, help and improve people’s sexual lives.
Love this podcast !!

2022-05-10 18:09:09	I can tell you how much I appreciate what you both do for your listeners!!  I have struggled with my identity and sexuality for most of the life I can remember.  Primarily as a result of religious and cultural indoctrination. I am healing and your openness and support has started me on my journey at 41 freaking years old but better late then never!  The guests and information presented provide a plethora of scientifically backed information that can absolutely change your sexual and emotional world!!  As a Kink Aware mental health provider I give this podcast a 10 out of 10 recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!	5	Vertical Ascent MT	Thank You
2022-05-03 22:21:22	"I’m new to the podcast and have only listened to about 10 or so, but I’m so thankful for women like you. Thank you for bringing on guests and having so much information to learn and read about. 

Due to the Emily Nagoski episode, I found and listened to her book, Come As You Are and it has really changed my life. I’ve had traumas in my life and I never realized how much they have impacted my sexual wellbeing and the way I see myself, so thank you. From the bottom of my heart. Thank you for making this amazing podcast and sharing the fun and laughter around sex! Also, I think my husband is pretty thankful too ;)"	5	msmippi	Thank you for making sex shameless!
2022-05-03 19:54:18	Really loved the episode with Natasha & Kenna. I didn’t know there was a place to be able to purchase used items from my favorite porn stars and the work that’s involved in making porn videos.	5	Caligirl2022	Fans Utopia & Kenna James

2022-04-22 16:45:36	This show has changed my life and helped me so much on my journey to rediscover myself as I heal from a nasty divorce. I love their realness, kindness, inclusivity, and vulnerability. The content never disappoints and is so thought provoking. Thank you April and Amy for your labor or love and trailblazing work to bring sex positivity to all humans in all places with love and free of shame.	5	Tondra Stowers	The. Best.
2022-04-16 17:36:06	April and Amy have helped me learn about myself while laughing and having huge aha's about the shame and emotions holding me back in my sex life. I even had a coaching session with Amy last year that got me to realize where I was settling with guys that could only provide a portion of what I actually needed. It made me vet my next guy pretty hard in terms of ability to take care of me & provide aftercare. And it's gone far beyond good & emotionally safe sex and lead to the best relationship I've ever had. Love you both!	5	Tara Alexandria	Favorite sex podcast
2022-04-12 23:26:12	My husband introduced me to your podcast. I am going to give you both so many props. Seriously. I had a bad teenage years with sexual abuse. I held it in for 15 years until I told my husband. I have pushed my husband away because of this. But now I turned 40. And I tell ya what, it has been the best sex ever. I am discovering him and what I like to do to him. I am also a massage therapist so that comes in handy. I can’t thank you two enough for helping me get through such a dark time. Oh and my husband thanks you too 😘	5	massage gurl	I am a shy massage therapist
2022-04-12 19:45:49	These girls are very knowledgeable and personable and provide a well rounded podcast on sex.  Amy even emailed me back with a very helpfully and comprehensive answer to my marriage problem.  I would totally recommend them to your daily commute to learn about sex.	5	Drtimko	One of the best sex podcasts our there today!
2022-04-12 09:03:47	First time mom here dealing with getting back into the groove of my sex life and I stumbled upon this podcast which has been THE BEST for my headspace. Here i am, writing this review at 4am, due to the amazing feedback from my partner. All it took was a little POWER POSE and it unleashed my confidence and amazed my YD 😝 which boosts my confidence even more. I definitely will continue to listen and support! Thank you ladies ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️	5	Ayzia Fields	Thank youuuuu!
2022-04-12 00:18:33	As someone that deals with a fair amount of shame of my own when it comes to sex and talking about sex  I'm gracious for Amy and April and the discussions they have on the show with a variety of guests. Though they haven't had an episode that directly talks about my issue yet (at least I don't think) it's all the more reason I'll keep listening. Love to you both!	5	mcslate	So Thankful
2022-04-10 14:52:11	Middle-aged married man here.  I started listening to this podcast after developing an interest in Sacred Sexuality (after a psychedelic experience).  I was a little leary to be perfectly honest, and the content is sometimes triggering to me personally.  That said, April and Amy completely won me over and I think I've listened to at least half of their podcasts episodes.  Their authernticity, honesty, and passion for the subject of human sexuality is very evident and their mission is to bring more pleasure, happiness and fulfilment into peoples' lives.  And they are just plain excellent at the craft of podcasting and interviewing people.  Keep up the good work gals!!!	5	DaffyJeffy	Challenging...but I love it

2022-04-05 02:07:35	I love to listen to educational sexy subjects while being presented by humans coming true. I’m a new listener and I have already purchased two Kyer Wiltshire books. Yes. Photo books from a podcast. The show has a fun vibe and leaves you with a sense of empowerment. Amy and April bring topics that are hot and good for you like soul food for your sex.	5	50 year old skater Joe	Shameless listener

2022-04-02 18:06:37	Wow! How incredibly brave of you chip and dip to be vulnerable and share your stories around sex and sexuality.

2022-03-30 08:58:25	I’m a 70 year old male, married over 45 years, but with a number of partners in my younger days. Trial and error + experience gives me pretty good knowledge about sex, but this podcast almost always teaches me something new or makes me laugh. Many episodes get me to reflect on how our “script” has changed over the years to become a much more varied and fun menu (still hoping to incorporated a few other things!). Two things keep me “coming” back for more (and exploring previous episodes) : First, Amy and April are honest, fun, and willing to share personal experiences in a delightful way. Second, their guests are knowledgeable and usually great at communicating ideas, techniques, and enthusiasm for great sex to the listener. Men... the path to better sex means listening to these ladies!	5	TWL51	Fun and informational 🍌🌮

2022-03-29 17:41:31	Educational. Nonjudgmental. Kind, honest hosts. Excellent information that you won’t find other places.

2022-03-23 15:33:18	The Shameless Crew is just the best. They deliver relevant, important, and crazy helpful sex information in a playful and fun way. The whole message of being less shameful - more open and OK with who you are as a sexual person is so helpful. We are lucky as a society that two women can create a podcast like this one. If you have not listened, you are missing out. They have many great podcasts.	5	Kkeels8	Love this podcast for all the sex and relationship advices
2022-03-16 12:41:55	Every new sexual awareness, an awakening really, that comes up in every show. Thanks for the fun approach you two ladies take, it is lighthearted but deep all in one delivery. I’m a fan!	5	big_OP	Fun to discover…
2022-03-13 00:14:04	It would be this one. I have learned more in the past two years than in my previous 30-year relationship. My ex and I were both raised in a very cult-like religion that controlled every aspect of our lives (including the bedroom, obviously) and my learning had simply stopped. The last two years have been incredible as I work to rid myself of shame, emotional pain, and feelings of rejection, and this podcast has been instrumental in my growth, my confidence, and my/our pleasure. My girlfriend thanked me for taking the chance to learn all that I have. So I thank you.	5	BulldogSingleton	If I were allowed to listen to just one podcast…

2022-02-27 21:12:55	I recently discovered this podcast in the midst of a trial seperation between my wife and I and have been listening to it for hours on end during my solo cross-country road trip.  The hosts are delightful and listening to them joke around almost feels like I have companions riding with me on this trip.  The conversations with the guests are often enlightening and often hit home for for me as I try to work on myself .  In addition to all the sex talk, many conversations are about romantic relationships in general that I know wish I knew and was mindful about in my life.  Namaste to my fellow listeners.	5	stigmatmartyr	Shameless Sex podcast has been a blessing

2022-02-24 05:32:41	"This podcast has changed my life. For the longest time I thought something was wrong with me since I didn’t often want sex. Not because I didn't like it, more so lack of desire. I decided to bring this up in my therapy and I was able to recognize the shame and trauma that has been built around sex since I was young. I found some books and I listened to a few other podcasts before finding Shameless Sex and now I can’t stop listening! I love listening to Amy and April and I find myself relating to them a lot! I am going through all the episodes from the beginning and keeping up with new episodes, and I look forward to every one of them! 

I have a lot of work to do still, but I have started to get more in touch with my sexual self and more comfortable with sexual topics and talking about sex. I also have a passion for education so I really appreciate everything Amy and April are doing to help people become more educated and aware about not just their sexuality, but their bodies and their relationships. I am connecting better than ever with my partner and have even decided to start non hormonal birth control to take control of my body and physical health. I absolutely love this podcast and I hope I can one day meet Amy and April to express my gratitude! -MJ"	5	ashelynsings	Learning Shameless Sex

2022-02-15 17:04:59	I’ve done a lot of reading and listening recently because my new partner was very open about numbers and anatomies in her past. I was having a hard time reconciling this with my own size and body image issues, even though she keeps telling me I’m perfect for her in every way. Listening to your size shame episode with Solomon I think will be a real turning point in how I approach my thoughts about myself and just learn to love what I have and accept that she loves me for more than what’s in my pants.

2022-02-08 21:35:11	Amy and April are a fantastic duo. There is enough contrast between the both of them that keeps their banter and the way they approach guest interviews, which keeps your “ear pressed to the speaker,” so to speak. Keep up the great work and keep on educating this society that appears to be so sex central, but is, in my opinion, so bashful  speaking about it. Thanks guys!	5	sonatapilgrim	Extremely Interesting
2022-02-03 17:49:43	LOVE this podcast! It has boosted my confidence and curiosity so much. It’s so refreshing hearing REAL conversations about things that are considered taboo in our society. Thank you for opening up a such a vulnerable and juicy topic! I feel like I’ve learned more valuable info from this podcast than my many years of indoctrinated “sex ed” which never even explained the fact that my urethra and vag are separate holes lol 😆 thank you ladies!!	5	kenzymoore	Vulnerable & Juicy

2022-01-16 16:22:47	"I am so thankful to have found this podcast!  I came to a major fork in the road in my life and I found this incredible art form that Amy and April have created.  I lived with a lot of shame around sexuality, only a little of which I was consciously aware of for such a long time.  I have started a new journey in my life and I’m now listening to my sexuality and I feel like I’m finally good with who I am.
I’m a heterosexual male.  I have really had a strong appreciation for some of the educators/mentors for the masculine but I also love learning more about vulvas and the feminine.  I can’t thank Shameless Sex enough for being an incredible platform for orgasmic pleasure, openness, curiosity, exploration and so much more!"	5	KNA 2	Thank you Amy & April
2022-01-16 16:30:58	Used to love this but I am taking a break.  I really want to hear from the guests but the hosts spend so much time on themselves the guests don’t get much room to run.  When the guests do get to make a point often the hosts just end up repeating the point but in a less articulate manner.  If the hosts spend less time chatting and put more emphasis on the guests then I might give it a try again.	2	willie9431	Taking a break
2022-01-05 17:41:51	Look forward to Tuesday every week when they release a new one. Amy and April are smart, knowledgeable, and funny. Although they have interesting guests, my favorite is the first 15 minutes or so where they two hosts talk about their lives. Always a fun and worthwhile listen.	5	wgajr1	Love this podcast
2021-12-29 20:40:28	Even though I consider myself a very sexual person, I was a little embarrassed to initially admit to my wife that I listen to it. We’ve been together 10 yrs and our sex life was always pretty good. However, after subscribing and listening for many months, Amy and April have taught me to become such a better communicator with my wife about sex and desire. We talk about the latest podcasts and discuss what we would want to try and not try and then put it into practice and our sex life is now absolutely amazing. You guys have opened up both our eyes about sex and relationships and what options (of which we may not have considered otherwise) are out there for us to try. Amy, April and their podcast are absolutely amazing and provide an essential service. Keep up the awesome work!!	5	secureikm	Love this podcast

2021-12-21 18:03:47	Amy and April bring a fun and lighthearted approach to exploring the good, the crazy, the kinky, and everything in between on their podcast. They are devoted to opening up the conversation about sex. And, in a culture that seems to shut down around sex, it’s incredibly refreshing to hear their interviews.	5	nate-doggg	The essential sex podcast
2021-12-14 16:25:34	I have really enjoyed your podcast. A lot of insightful information that’s very nice to hear from other people. If there was one feedback I could give. It would be that there are several times where I have tried to listen to a full podcast and it’s very hard because one of you lovely ladies and I’m not sure which one I am so sorry, speaks incredibly fast, so fast that it’s hard to understand what she is saying. Other than that a high five star rating for you guys information is amazing	5	SantanaDiana	Love it.
2021-12-11 19:33:38	Dr. Alison Ash spoke so well about the positive reality of fantasies in our lives.  She worked with the research by Dr. Justin Lehmiller and looked at the many different types of fantasies.  Along with Amy and April, she talked about exploring these fantasies and talking with them with a partner.  They addressed the reality of shame and how to talk about the fantasies in different ways so as to help the partner understand and perhaps participate.  This was a freeing piece.	5	Tom the learner	so helpful
2021-12-10 19:42:41	I love shameless sex almost as much as Amy and April love uberlube haha! They have been an integral part of my growth as a sexual being, and many of their episodes have given my partner and me great insight in our journey of reigniting and opening our relationship. Looking forward to seeing you next Tuesday!	5	Squid Hampton	Educational and entertaining
2021-12-08 16:15:44	I was with the same woman (prude and narcissist) for roughly 13 years through my late teens and 20s. After escaping I was a little lost. I was shamed and never got a chance to explore what makes me happy. I’m now with a great woman who is from the opposite side of the spectrum. This podcast does a great job of explaining and normalizing within reason. It gives us lots of talking points and helps draw lines for what we collectively are ok with.	5	Inkspade816	Great Listen

2021-12-07 20:51:56	I enjoy this podcast a lot, but I hate sifting through the intro. In the most recent episode, there were 18 minutes of introduction/promotional talk. EIGHTEEN MINUTES! Good lord. Why not just have a 90-second intro and then get into it? Ehhh. First world problems…	3	Taz808	Great, but intros are very looooong…
2021-12-07 00:18:00	What happened to terms like ‘men’ and ‘women’?	1	dbdoubleu	PC language is too much
2021-12-02 03:03:30	I love this podcast! Amy and April are very down to earth with advice and their own personal stories, which is refreshing to hear. Their guests are highly educated and insightful and informative!! Plus you guys are funny!!! Keep it up!!!!	5	noomex yock	Shameless sex
2021-11-30 19:24:06	There are so many things about this podcast I love. The info is great. They are great at interviewing. They are sexpositive and so respectful. The voices (impressions or just changes their voices) they both do (but especially April) are incredibly distracting and can get tiresome. I have found myself turning off the podcast sometimes when it gets to much during the intro or sex question which is a shame.	2	Cmbholland	Less voices
2021-11-29 17:18:26	I really love listening to you girls. The topics covered are well-rounded. The interview questions are great. The comedy tickles me, lol. The guests are so informative and you both do such a great job clarifying the information we're all learning along the way. I really want to learn my options on how to become certified in sex health and education. I would love your feedback!	5	NatBender	I LOVE this podcast!
2021-11-25 19:32:47	I have been listening to this podcast for about a year now. I try to catch as many old episodes as I can. The information is wonderful and the authenticity is truly beautiful. Amy and April have a way of making you feel included with there education and humor. Wonderful job ladies!	5	Edward Cordeiro	Knowledgeable, Wonderful, Authentic and Inclusive
2021-11-25 00:39:33	Trying to rekindle the love making in my marriage and your podcast has been so helpful.. It’s a work in progress but you have given me so much advice Thank You	5	Big fundamentals	Thank You
2021-11-21 14:55:51	I love listening to you gals in the morning when I’m getting ready for work! You have literally opened my eyes and mind to so many ways of getting in touch with my own sexuality, what brings pleasure to myself instead of only trying to please my partner, and the guests that you bring to your table are a wealth of information! Thank you so much for your good work and for being the fantastic, beautiful people that you are! The world needs more people like you!💗	5	Sandy💗🍬	Sexology!
2021-11-01 04:27:25	._.._. ._.._…	5	ehhhh i guess	i jerk off to this podcast
2021-10-28 22:02:27	I really love to listen to their banter, the guests are always pretty interesting and I always enjoy the topics. I have been known to share the episodes and send them to my husband when the topic or conversation turns to something we might be struggling with. Love them!	5	jessdelarambula	Such a fun and informative show!
2021-10-20 01:54:21	Hi ladies I love listening to your podcast I enjoyed every day I come home from work I learn more and more every day even though I am 53 years old I still am learning about sex and thank you very much	5	Moab1968	Hi
2021-10-18 14:32:12	I have been a fan for almost a year now and have listened to upwards of 100 episodes. I can’t thank these women enough for creating a shameless discussion about a topic that is so central to all of our lives, yet so under-spoken and difficult to find quality information about. If you are curious about how you can enhance your bedroom (or whatever room) experiences or to understand the experiences of others, these ladies deliver expertise in the field of sexuality in a light hearted, open-minded, and raw package.	5	PDED1	Life expanding
2021-09-30 02:01:51	Thanks	5	cobaltdav	Love ya both, thanks
2021-09-25 18:51:15	I’ve been listening to Amy and April for a while now and I’ve learned so much that I wasn’t fully aware of. I’ve studied some about the psychology of sexuality but these lovely women have opened up more things and possibilities for me to study. You ladies are phenomenal. Much love!!!	5	Khaotic_Enigma	Hella informative.
2021-09-18 12:02:44	I love your podcast you ladies bring awesome content and bring a different perspective on human sexuality and the openest of sharing your thoughts to the world 🌎 Thanks for the awesome content #FastedHuman	5	CoachErickP	2 Sexy Señoritas of Podcasting
2021-09-15 03:17:07	I have an amazing idea for a sex toy that no one has ever made. I need some advice on how to go about getting in out there and used. Can you help please? Thanks so much!!	5	appleciber	Sex Toys
2021-09-11 04:12:55	I like the different perspective of sex and intimacy without the porn star mentality.	5	Krewzlo	Love the show
2021-09-01 12:46:46	So thankful for this Amy and April, they are Light hearted and fun to listen to. Your podcast was the first stop in a deep dive into my sexuality, happiness and sexual self confidence. Your positive talk and “shameless” attitude really helped me open up to both myself and my partner. Thank you so much for all that you have shared!! (He says thank you too😉)	5	brightandbrains	Don’t stop!
2021-09-10 07:05:14	I know wayyyyyy too much about the hosts and not anything else. Feels more like a show about their lives. Their opinions. Their experiences. Not ever are they suggesting or saying what should be done or what to try.	1	n333ky	Couldn’t catch any of their advise
2021-08-26 14:51:18	This podcast is so well produced and enjoyable to listen to. Amy and April are real role models for sex positivity and I always learn something new. Highly recommended!	5	other amy	Fun, funny, and informative
2021-09-01 11:52:07	"I waited to get thru first forty episodes to write a review hoping issues would getter better. Topics and info are awesome but the poor audio controls are frustrating. Sometimes the hosts are hard to hear and the guest is very loud causing me to change the volume a hundred times per episode. Sometimes guests are quiet and hosts are loud. This is made worse when the hosts do their “funny” voices (Wisconsin, Italian… ). The voices are mildly annoying but become more so because they talk louder when doing them which makes the audio discrepancies more annoying. 
I will continue to listen. I am hopeful they get this figured out with experience and, if they do, I will be glad to adjust the review up and give the show the rating they could have based on the great content and guests."	3	NavyGator1993	Great topics, need production help
2021-08-25 02:36:16	You two are amazing and thank you for this amazing podcast.	5	Mehdi Fx	Wonderful podcast
2021-08-20 20:01:57	For starters this podcast is a great find (popped up under suggestions) the host dynamic is amazing. Audio quality is good, episode titles and notes are easy to understand and look forward to. With 100+ episodes it’s always hard to navigate old episodes or if one is a revisit, not a problem here. The only negative I have would be wanting more of the banter between the hosts. I enjoy the guests however sometimes they go on too long and give a ton of information to sift through. Asking more questions would allow the listener to take a second to understand in those moments and give us a bit more of that fun. The hosts are super respectful, ultra even. I love it and this podcast. Keep up the good work and anyone trying to decide, give it a shot I don’t think you’ll be disappointed!	5	33voorhees	I’m a New Listener
2021-08-20 05:11:03	Keep on doing a great job.	5	Danimalisimo	Love you two!
2021-08-18 11:22:52	I always love when this show comes out every week … it rocks!	5	Sirdotcom	Excellent Show
2021-08-17 23:06:58	Frank discussion of so many topics that focuses on knowledge, understanding and personal development, presented in a fun and engaging format.  I wish I’d known about them years ago. One of my three critical sex, relationships and wellness podcasts.	5	Greenie58	Required Listening for Sex, Relationships
2021-08-11 04:47:43	Learned lots!	5	Kikasoid	Fun and informative!
2021-07-07 15:33:02	Absolutely love your podcast. Listened to several over days, weeks, & months. Always get something out of them. But seriously the Kissing episode…..I think it’s was #230. Omg! That hit home so much! Kissing means so much to me & speaks to my soul. This helped me to understand so much about myself!! I used to get so much out of kissing my X, now I also realize when the intimacy of kissing went away I didn’t know how to get it back even when I said how much it meant to me. Now I know why our marriage suffered because of it. Granted not the only problem in our marriage but when you don’t have the little things the big things become bigger. Total Ah Ha moment!!!! So now I know to make sure my future partner knows how much kissing means to me. Thank you ladies!!!	5	Mismissyv	Ok the greatest!
2021-07-09 23:19:26	I’ll never know if I like this show because I couldn’t get past the constant interruptions and talking over each other by the hosts. They never let one another finish a sentence. I’ll give it two stars because the topics sounded interesting.	2	LadyLaneIsMyName	So much interrupting
2021-06-30 19:34:29	Love this podcast! So informative, educational & sexy!!! Highly recommend	5	kimbooty20	Sexy Talk with beautiful ladies
2021-06-25 21:45:53	These 2 girls get it. I have listened to other pod casts and felt like they were man bashing. Amy and April not only have fun but are edgucational. If I could I would love to just hang out with these 2 for a weekend.	5	Samsung1-	Shameless Sex is the bomb
2021-06-09 06:13:09	April and Amy have great chemistry! This podcast is such a valuable resource for anyone wanting insight into all things sexual. Always great subjects with amazing guests. I have really enjoyed diving into their huge back catalog of episodes as well as current episodes.	5	Curious Sexual Explorer	A must listen!
2021-05-29 04:38:23	I struggle with body acceptance, sexual trauma, and intimacy. This podcast has helped me explore my sexuality and has inspired me to try new things. I don’t feel so broken and alone like I used to be. I love how inclusive Amy and April are. They truly want to help people. Thanks guys! You rock my world!	5	EBrumbaugh	Love love love this!!!
2021-06-04 07:01:12	Me and my wife love the show but you guys tend to rant on and on and never go in depth and stay on topic in full detail I.E. techniques, how too’s ect.	1	Barry MCkockinger	Please stop the rants!
2021-05-26 19:52:19	I’ve been with my wife for 11 years and she is the only person I’ve ever been intimate with. I’ve always had a much higher libido than her and it has at times caused strain on our relationship. Thanks to a sex club we found pre pandemic and informative podcasts such as Shameless Sex, we’ve improved our Sex life significantly. But when it comes to ejaculating inside her she is usually reluctant because my semen messes up her PH balance and causes irritation. Is there a way for me to change my body chemistry through diet or other means so we could enjoy this experience?	5	Mr. GreenDaddy	PH balance and creampies
2021-05-21 17:59:48	I am 51 years old and had been sexfree for many many many years after a divorce.  Recently got back into sex.  i do not have alot of sexual experiance so this podcast is teaching me things i did not know or have forgotten  Maybe even giving me more confidence to at least try to open up	5	itsjustme1969	Getting my groove back
2021-05-20 22:44:34	Great sex ed podcast. The chemistry between the host is very good. Very informative while fun, funny and entertaining. They also consistently have the best sex expert or highly entertaining guest on. Highly recommended.	5	anthonydavisinc	Outstanding
2021-05-12 00:56:29	Thank you ladies!  My wife and have always had a “good” sexual relationship but all long-term relationships tend to stagnate. For us not in a bad way but just needed to re-discover.  We are finding that your advice and your podcasts are inspiring and teaching us some good and safe new things.	5	GA happily married man	25th anniversary and 50th birthdays coming up and thank you!!!!
2021-04-29 17:25:53	I am so very grateful to have stumbled upon this podcast. It has really changed the way I navigate my sexuality, my marriage, and even everyday life! You ladies are amazing and I have gained so much insight into myself through you and your wonderful guests. Thank you for all you do!	5	emeraldabyss	Forever grateful!
2021-04-28 04:36:47	"I stumbled on this series about 2 months ago and it has taken my loving marriage up to the next level. It’s also improved my own understanding of the limited sex education I got in the Midwestern culture during my adolescence. 

I now tell my close friends all about it and I recommend them start with episodes 1 (intro), 2 (finding your core erotic theme), 14 (becoming erotic superstar), 17 (keeping relationships going), 168 (guidelines for relationships) to all my married friends as an introduction and then suggest they dabble in all the topics like my wife and I have. 

I’ve listened to about half the series now and am now focusing on the recent episodes. Thank you Amy and April for creating great content for people at all stages of their sexual journey.  You are really making the world a better place.

Signed,
One of your many male fans"	5	Neilcritter.	Fabulous enhancement to sex education
2021-04-27 19:01:29	I’m 52 and rediscovering my true sexual pleasure. A gentleman friend recommended this podcast to me and it’s been fantastic!	5	Anniegirl3769	Loving the info!
2021-04-26 20:37:53	Absolutely love your show. Came across this show because my teenage son asked if he should watch more porn to learn what to do with his girlfriend. I got scared for him and remembered I used to listen to Ginger and Christy on XM and wished i found a show like that when I was young. So I scanned through some podcasts and when I came across you two I knew if I could get my son to listen and absorb the information I would not have to worry as much about him or his girl or partner. I hope I’ve raised a free spirited gentleman and am really hoping he listens to you ladies as I feel your advice would help him tremendously. The past month I’ve listened to you as much as I could and I truly feel the show has benefited me in my own love and sex life. Thank you so very much for sharing your knowledge and stories and time to help people enjoy a more shameless and compassionate lifestyle. Episode 56❤️❤️❤️💚💚💚can save the world	5	philthykazols	Happy dad
2021-04-17 21:37:03	I thought I knew a lot about sex but as it turns out there is a lot more to learn and understand. Definitely helped me think about my sex life in a different way and I am excited about it!	5	Alaskagirl66	Super fun, funny, and highly educational!

I’ve been feeling so much shame for what I wanted, what I was interested in because it doesn’t align with the mainstream, but it’s been so freeing to hear other like minded people.  Not only has it been healing, but they are equipping me with the tools I need to successfully Ve me. Thank you ladies!!! ❤️❤️❤️	5	Hheather0284	Sooo Freeeing
2021-04-14 00:34:56	I’ve been listening since the beginning and have found the information, the guests and Amy and April’s perspective to be transformative.

2021-04-07 00:48:33	Love this podcast. They cover all the topics. Even topics that don’t pertain to me I find myself listening to.

Great podcast and I often share with my wife or like minded friends. Keep it up!	5	Jonnymartin	Love this podcast
2021-04-06 21:03:16	"Wide range of topics and content covered well by people who know their stuff. Guests are always appropriate for the topic and professionals in the field. Hosts are clearly knowledgeable and extremely witty, i literally LOL at work sometimes.

2021-04-04 03:03:41	Just a quick one. Have not had an outbreak in 25 years. Once every 3-5 years I get that feeling you described (always when stressed) and when I feel that strange tingling, I rub lavender oil on that area. TOTALLY works, feeling gone by next morning, one treatment	5	Yaaaaaayy	Your episode herpes
2021-03-31 01:01:20	I love shameless sex so much. These ladies have tapped into such a harmonious and sweet energy together. They discuss sex in a way that is somehow liberating, educating and empowering all at the same time. I learn about aspects of sex and intimacy that I never even considered. Especially for people who may have been raised to think sex is wrong or bad, or anyone who feels a bit sexually repressed, I highly recommend this podcast.	5	janer937	Smart, sexy and fun
2021-03-30 19:25:39	This podcast is amazing! These two really know what they’re talking about and my relationships have more than improved because of this show.

2021-01-10 05:03:45	"Love this podcast but I think you should have an episode where you both go online and find sex stories or questions and talk about what they should of done of should do (I recommend wiki how) Also you could have an episode where you both have sex together on mic and describe how it feels how it tastes and what you are doing or you have sex with each other but you video tape it and put it on you tube with the link below the podcast.... please do these and thank you 

The person behind the screen"	4	Podcast_and_app_lover	It was good but have an idea💡
2021-03-13 00:41:34	These women have great info which literally can change your life! They provide some great advice and hilarious banter which makes every minute fun yet useful.

2021-03-04 17:12:23	These sexy ladies are so fun to listen to. The honesty, the helpful tips and tricks and the informative guests make this a great sex podcast.

2021-02-19 21:06:34	I love this podcast. I look forward to each episode but I must say my very very favorite guest is Rain DeGrey. However I have enjoyed all the guests. Amy and April are very knowledgeable about all things sex and they represent the sex positive community awesomely! Highly recommend this podcast to seasoned sexperts as much as newly interested explorers. I hope this podcast continues for a very long time and helps with the continued evolving movement of sex positivity!	2	thatsjustme777	My favorite podcast
2021-02-08 09:34:03	The info in generally good, but the major marketing that goes on during the podcast is terrible.  Don’t even try the products out. You’ll likely be disappointed. If you like buzzwords and blatant marketing this is your podcast.	2	Mr.poopie doop	Shameless marketing
2021-01-19 16:10:57	Not bad, but for a podcast called shameless sex, you sure do shame people who have differing opinions from yourselves. Open minded until you disagree, then someone needs to be shunned and ridiculed!	3	Melanie Melinda	Needed this!
2021-01-17 21:36:35	I love the banter between you two and your positivity and positive attitudes. You guys are great 💜	5	Jacquelinebjj	Such a  fun show 💜
2021-01-15 15:58:05	These women are great! Not only does their show have amazing advice, tips and information about sex but I found myself applying theirs and their experts knowledge about sex to many other areas of my personal and professional relationships.  Incredible job ladies keep it up!	5	DRE0225	Longtime listener
2021-01-14 21:33:31	I stumbled upon this podcast over a year ago as I was struggling to communicate with my partner about all things related to sex and sexuality. The straight forward, no nonsense, and extremely practical advice, insight, and tips that I hear on the podcast are absolutely invaluable in the real world. Well not every subject pertains to my situation, every single episode is entertaining, informative, and well worth every minute that I listen. I seriously need to meet a partner like these two!	5	Mychal99	Where do I find a girl like this?
2021-01-09 00:05:25	Love this podcast. I waited until I got engaged to have sex for the first time and was very scared the first time and listening to this has helped so much. My fiancé has always said I was the best she ever had but I started listening to this podcast and trying the tips and she was mind blown so thank you for all you do.	5	MrPin3Appl3	Amazing
2021-01-07 00:29:51	I started listening to you ladies late 2019 and caught up in no time. You have taught me so much on how to be myself not only in the bedroom but as a individual! After being in a not so swell long term relationship, starting over was hard....then you ladies came along. I have never been so confident and learned so much than I have while listening to you. Between learning new tricks myself, to sharing my knowledge with coworkers/friends/etc , I can honestly say you have changed my life. Not to mention you have made it easier to figure out how to teach my daughter about her sexuality as she grows up. Thank you so much for being so inviting to everyone into the shameless sex revolution! Keep doing what you do!	5	Kayteee76	Thank you!
2021-01-07 02:21:45	I have been thinking about sex but my ex wife says it is ok for her to feel other wise	3	bb4357	I have been thinking
2021-01-05 20:39:11	Don’t be shallow and think men can’t learn from this show! It is great for men too in helping get things back on track	5	VirginiaVol	Awesome show!
2021-01-04 21:36:42	So straight forward. Love this show. I’ve learned so much. Keep up the great work ladies!!!	5	liz8076	Love this show!!
2020-12-12 22:28:37	Coming from an abusive, traumatic, neglectful and extreme religious childhood, I’ve been trying to find my authentic self for a while now. This episode really spoke to my soul! Thank you so much ladies for sharing and caring!!!	5	BecomingAmazon	Spoke to my soul
2020-12-31 17:48:26	Naïve and misguided, the hosts have a misunderstanding of the effects of pornography on the male brain. Their advice for men who are struggling with this problem, is not based in a realistic assessment of the effects of chronic porn viewing.	2	Streamfinder	Oblivious
2020-12-08 22:23:58	Been listening to y’all for years and you’ve absolutely changed my life. Because of all the growth you’ve helped me through I hope to help others in the same ways. Thank you for all you do to make the world a more shameless and sexy place	5	Carat_Stick	Love!
2020-12-06 22:17:18	You two always keep me company on my 3 hour drives back and forth to care for my mom at her place in Steamboat  Springs CO.  I always learn something new, there is always something that makes me laugh and there is always something I want to learn more about on your show.  I am considering learning to apply my massage background in a new way which could be a great career move at this time.  Something to do with trauma massage treatment for those that could benefit would be where I would like to concentrate.   Thank you for enriching my life in so many ways. Love you two!! From Jennifer in Arvada, CO	5	Blondehippychick	Simply da Best!
2020-12-05 21:00:26	Love this podcast and why I love it is because it helps normalize so much of what I hear from clients, friends, self and everyone in between. We live in a culture that shames women for owning their sexuality and in the next breath shames women for not owning or respecting themselves when in fact being sexual is respecting them self. My example is Miley Cyrus at the MTV awards getting lambasted for being sexual when I want to yell “YOU CREATED HER, you can’t be mad now.” In other other words, we live in a culture that is OBSESSED with sex and all thing sex but hide in the darkness, lie, obscure, deceive all those around us. If we could just be honest without shame about who we are, what we enjoy and celebrate that like this podcast we’d be in a much better place. Also I live in the US so we are mostly sexually repressed as children and shamed so it takes quite the undoing in adulthood to live into ourselves. Thanks Amy and April for providing a space to let the mind be free and be okay with wherever we are at.	5	agcash	Freeing/Relieving/ also sad

2020-11-25 15:24:08	As a married male, who’s going through sexual discovery in a marriage with a dead bedroom, this podcast has given me comfort and confidence! My only wish is that my wife would have the same modest of these two amazing and professional women!	5	nsnead	THE Best!
2020-11-25 03:43:44	"I’ve been featured multiple times on Shameless Sex Podcast and each time a new experience has been made. The attention to detail and overall fluidity Amy & April have provided with this space and speaking about Sex from different points of view, angles, subjects is exceptional and unlike any other I’ve seen, bar none. 

Each week I am inspired by the diverse people they have on their platform. This safe space they have created to share, to learn, and to grow is very felt & very needed. Thank you both very much!"	5	Headusa Divine	I LOVE SHAMELESS from Headusa Divine‼️

2020-09-30 15:11:01	I’m a new listener to your podcast and I feel very fortunate to have found you! I love the insightful interviews and the sexy spice that is peppered throughout! So empowering for women to own their sexuality and to talk about it!  Keep being your beautiful, sexy, and amazing selves❤️😍😘	5	Lovelyleslie41	Empowering and thoughtful
2020-09-28 23:10:29	This was my first ever podcast I started listening to. I was hooked immediately! I’ve listened to every episode since I found this podcast in 2018. So much great information! And I’ve recommended this podcast to so many people! And Amy and April... I love them!!	5	MariahMorris48	OBSESSED! Very informative and overall just, amazing!
2020-09-28 20:46:32	"I look forward to Tuesday’s so I can learn something new about my body, my partner’s body, how to communicate about sensitive subjects, or something that has nothing to do with me but expands my horizons.  I love this podcast and consider it a must listen.  Started when I was recently divorced and single, and now am in a conscious, monogamous relationship. And it always applies.  
And I love how April and Amy take constrictive criticism into account and work to improve themselves and the podcast. 
Thank you for keeping me entertained and educated and erotic and curious and turned on!"	5	Claudia - Amarsi	Fun, sexy, informative, raw, inclusive - all the things
2020-09-17 19:32:57	I enjoy Shameless Sex every time I listen to it. It’s fun, personal, and  informative.	5	Markus Fromherz	Fun and informative show
2020-09-12 20:47:06	I started listening to the podcast after Amy & April after they were on another podcast I love. They are so much fun, inspiring, silly, smart, & sexy. I love listening to you ladies. Thanks for what you’re doing.	5	lizlizard83	I’m in love
2020-09-08 02:41:49	Let me just first say that I love you guys! My boyfriend and I listen to your podcast all the time! We listen to them together, but a lot of the time we end up listening to them on our own and it makes for a great discussion when we’re together! We have now exploded so much and have purchased suggested products from your podcast and we have never been let down! Thank you so much for turning our great sex life into an amazing sex life!!	5	nature loving girl	Best Informative Sex Podcast Out There!!!
2020-09-07 11:32:52	"I adore this podcast.  As a 56 year old woman I’ve recently come to terms with the sexual abuse of my childhood.  
I felt I’d never be able to stay in my body during sex and achieve orgasm.  
With the resources and advice from these two amazing women, I am officially a squirter!
I now love sex and enjoy adding new things to my repertoire. 
With each episode I learn something new and interesting."	5	Birdsong620	Educational & Fun!
2020-09-05 18:45:48	I got divorced 4 years ago. I never went to therapy for it. It’s taken years, good friends and periodic self-breakthroughs to really be able to mourn the loss of the relationship and marriage. It’s still an ongoing process. Some days there’s a revelation/epiphany. Others, no movement forward and occasional steps back as I get sad or frustrated. This episode really helped me. Thank you.	5	parkinsons2009	I feel the pain
2020-09-02 18:38:40	First of all, I am a male who accidentally came across your podcast. I listened to one episode and  I fell in love. I immediately told my wife about shameless sex and we are going to listen to an episode together. Being a male, your podcasts really taught me to understand a woman in a totally different way. not only sexually but emotionally as well. I feel my wife and I are really going to benefit from you two. Thank you for what you do and keep up the uplifting work.	5	fkjrdrjdjdjdjdjdj	Life changer
2020-09-02 11:00:09	"Excellent sex podcast! Very educational with lots of professional guests loaded with a very humane touch AND super sweet sense of humor. The Double A (Amy & April) Ladies also offer great resources through their sponsors in addition to their knowledge!
Keep rocking the party Amy & April.

2020-08-23 01:41:36	I love this podcast! I am a mother of 3 little ones (all under age 6) and love listening to this! Thank you for sharing all your knowledge and encouraging me to learn more about myself and helping my husband and I keep the spark in our relationship! (13 years together, 7 years married). You both are so wonderful and approachable. I just listened to the episode of Amy and her partner and loved learning about non-violent communication. (PS, April and Amy, I didn’t have to unsubscribe to write my review. Also, I’m slowly making my way to present day episodes, I’m still in 2019, and wanted to mention to April to check out Native Deoderant if she hasn’t already)	5	zensarahmom	Authentic, approachable, and amazing!!!
2020-09-01 03:04:17	Come on people. My kids watch this	1	therealemma72	No language
2020-08-24 03:23:28	"For starters, I’m a SWM but I just don’t feel like this show is for me personally. There are some good tips and discussions in there but you have to wait for them among a lot of other stuff (updates on their personal lives that I’m sure are helping people be open and discuss these things but I really just don’t care about, ads, jokes that I find start out not really funny and become somewhat intolerable by the end of the show). EDIT: they scaled back on the personal life updates in later episodes so this is less of a concern now.
I am very happy with the inclusive language used and when they do actually get down to discussing the topic at hand and get semi-serious, there’s good info in there most of the time.
However, I think most of this is just me and people shouldn’t be deterred from checking this out if they think it might be helpful to them. I think they’re probably doing good work for plenty of people, I just don’t think I’m one of them."	3	TheCreature8	Not for Me
2020-08-16 19:02:04	Thanks so much for all of your efforts to help us all find out way to shameless sex. I started listening a few months ago to try and Spice up my sex life. I’m a 61 year of cis gendered bisexual female in a 33 year loving and committed relationship. I am also a scientist who has taught a lot of anatomy and physiology so I thought I was pretty knowledgeable about sexuality and the body. After listening for some time I realized there is so much I didn’t know. The variety of your subjects and interviews have added so much to my knowledge and sex life. I love your sex questions and the way you both are so open and vulnerable on the show. I share it with all of my friends. Sharing your podcasts with my husband has led to some amazing discussions.	5	debusque	So much knowledge
2020-08-19 02:13:55	I couldn’t find how to contact y’all with feedback. I’m a new listener- but I had to say in episode 181 Kim Anami she really villanizes allopathic/western medicine. I am a current medical student soon to be physician and strongly feel that as people seeking to heal and help we should work together. While medicine and especially its treatment of women is far from ideal, and there is much that needs to be studied, it is wrong to paint all doctors as people who only look to gain financially from their patients. Of course Kim herself has a financial incentive to tell listeners that their doctors will betray them, and they must seek her guidance and products to find satisfaction in their sex lives. There are many doctors, many female doctors, who treat their patients with dignity and respect who fight for them to lead their fullest lives. As you mentioned that you were triggered/activated by her comments so was I.	3	Mooooooooooooodini	Villanization
2020-08-12 23:42:01	So I’ve just started getting back into podcasting and I seriously love this one. I love how open y’all are and when I listen I feel I can just be shameless. I’m 30 and not dating anyone right now but this is all still so helpful.	5	kayyteee_	Omg.
2020-08-06 01:31:38	I just started listening to your podcast today! The few episodes I have listened to have definitely opened my mind to some new things! Before, I was definitely weird about anal play and prostate play/pleasure. Me and my fiancé have tried it recently but it still a little weird. Listening to your most recent pod, my mind has been 100% opened to it!! Thank you for the great content! I will definitely be frequent listener!😀	5	Mr.bikeman30	A new look
2020-08-02 04:45:07	"I started listening to this podcast around 1-2 months ago and I have learned so much! I always listen to the first part of your podcasts (prior to the guest's introduction). I am a 31-year-old cisgender female. I have recently become oddly interested in my own sexual gratification. I say oddly because I was previously fine with not having an orgasm during penetrative sex. Nothing is wrong with clitoral orgasms; they are great! It was that I accepted what people told me when I'd asked about it. That statistically, most women cannot orgasm by penetration alone. Now, I'm not so sure. Orgasm isn't my goal personally, pleasure is. 

Since I have begun this newfound curiosity to figure out what I like, I have begun feeling pleasure more so than I ever really felt in the past. I never felt much during intercourse. I am slowly learning how to talk to my partner about what I like or don't like. It's a process, and requires me to get rid of the lump I get in my throat when I think to say something. I'm not sure why I feel weird about it... Other than my upbringing in this society as a woman! 😉"	5	a2c5$rach	Personable, Educational, Genuine, and Inclusive!
2020-08-05 14:51:30	Waste of time	1	MikeMach44	God awful
2020-07-31 01:16:40	Just discovered this podcast (blush). However, after listening to two episodes, I’m sold. This is not a raunchy, sex talk pod...it is fun, lots of professional advice. Thank you!	5	bruhs	Fun banter but science-based advice
2020-08-01 23:27:02	Listened to the most recent episode supposedly on blow job tips. Over 20 minutes of the hosts talking about random things before the guest arrived, who just marketed her books and services but didn’t actually give any tips. Super lame.	1	Hungry wham	Lots of talking, not much advice
2020-07-25 04:30:50	I’m a new listener and already, I want to scream this show from the rooftops. I am a firm believer that the final frontier is womyn’s sexual liberation, that a fully liberated woman is the answer to what ails our planet. I am so grateful to April and Amy for doing this work. It is a crucial part of the revolution. Healthy, fulfilling, empowering sex, equal pay, healthcare for all, justice, equality, LGBTQ+ rights, immigration rights, BIPOC thriving, let’s go, we want it ALL in 2020. Mask up and orgasm!	5	Britt PC	2020’s Medicine
2020-07-23 21:08:53	The open commentary about all subjects on the Shamelss Sex podcast is absolutely wonderful. I love how relatable Amy and April make every topic, not just sex specific topics. There was a recent episode where Amy opened up about her painful breakup and shared some of her emotions and coping mechanisms and it was so beautiful for me as someone going through my own painful divorce. Topics like that are not often opened up and shared about and I loved it! They are both also shameless about things they have gone through and experienced in their lives and are passionate about making everyone feel included. Just listening to the way they do not judge or shame anyone for anything makes me be a more inclusive person in my own life. I now think more often about using inclusive language and about not judging others for the way they explore their sexuality and lives. I have gained so much help, insight, and personal growth from the Shamless Sex podcast, I highly recommend it as one of my very favorite podcasts.	5	Machellar	Beautifully Open   Inclusive
2020-07-22 17:20:22	if you found this, you’ve listened to the rest, now you can listen to the best! these two vagina awning people are awesome!

I am completely addicted, and I guarantee if you give it a listen you will be too!	5	Brewndruid	One of the best out there!
2020-07-21 18:22:16	These ladies provide a fun and insightful podcast on the topic of sex along with all things that fall under it. I enjoy their perspective and April’s comical touch. I especially like hearing about the different sex toys they’ve used, it’s purpose, and where to find it bc it gives me good ideas for the next item to buy with some first hand knowledge on quality products.	5	TiffBRN	Entertainment on the topic of sex
2020-07-16 05:29:39	I’ve been listening to this podcast for over a year and like a fine wine it just gets better and better!

2020-07-16 02:59:30	I’ve always been super sexual and ashamed of my hyper sexuality.  You ladies have normalized women to be as sexual as our male counterparts. It makes me speak up about sexuality and not be ashamed of my inner feelings. Thanks! I appreciate your conversations and making me more empowered!!	5	Allyours574	Sexually liberating
2020-07-08 23:35:27	I love this podcast so much! April and Amy are so funny and so smart it feels like I'm in the room with them.

2020-06-30 23:22:48	I always thought I was adventurous and open to anything but this podcast has me realizing I had no idea I had “shame” in liking certain things.

2020-06-09 19:43:31	I love how open this podcast is. I was raised in the “Bible Belt” and sex was taboo to talk about. This podcast is incredibly refreshing because very few people in my childhood hometown had the same viewpoints on sex and there was a lot of shaming and judging around sex. I love what you ladies do and I absolutely enjoy every minute of it. Keep being rock stars and shamelessly enjoying the great pleasures of this world. ❤️❤️ lots of love from Oklahoma	5	Zzzztttniudsyhbddhnkommcshvfx	Uninhibited sex conversations

2020-05-11 11:01:00	I like that they talk about sex as if people talk about the weather. I started listening to the show during my morning walks. Then I got my wife to start listening on her afternoon walks. Now, we are able to talk about more sexual topics. Thanks Ladies!	5	Retro Dude	Great Show

2020-04-18 01:46:49	"My favorite podcast!! I’ve found at least one golden nugget of wisdom from every episode and love how Amy and April can both give insight from their own areas of expertise! I also love their dynamic together - they cultivate an atmosphere that is fun and loving, yet vulnerable and real at the same time.

They produce this podcast as a passion project because they see the need for a world without shame surrounding sexuality, and do their best to create meaningful and relevant content for all (and this comes with some “PC” overtones - but personally I don’t think there’s anything wrong with going out of our way to be more inclusive). Thank you for all the work you put into this and please know that your hard work and dedication is appreciated and valued!"	5	Ceasy like sunday mornin'	Throwing some love out there!

2020-03-26 19:05:06	So great! So much insight. As a man it’s great to hear the perspective of two smart, confident, embodied women. Great balance of sharing opinions, and an openness to the perspectives of others. Conscientious and sensitive without being too preachy. Fun, educational and HOT! This is the podcast for anyone who wants to learn more about themselves, their partners and wants to have amazing sex!	5	Zdstroy	I never miss an episode!
2020-03-25 22:01:02	I used to enjoy this show until listening to the coronavirus podcast. Very inappropriately describing others who are not on the same political spectrum as the hosts. Additionally, a lot of what they have to say is not backed up by any facts.	1	jlm00008	Very biased opinions
2020-03-24 22:01:01	I can’t do it anymore.  Too woke, too anti-men, too pro-woman, too much victim card, too much everything wrong with this me too/woke/offended society.  Used to like listening for tips and helpful insight but I’m done.	1	paul serone	Can’t
2020-03-12 23:04:32	I’ve loved binging on this show since coming across it last month. The hosts are not just fun and informative, they share their own personal experiences on many sensitive/private subjects, reminding us that we all share common concerns, (that we just might think are unique only to ourselves). Listening is like hanging out with two effervescent friends-getting tips and advice, along with thought-provoking topics to ponder from their assortment of guests.	5	SunnyshineHarmon	Favorite new podcast
2020-03-12 20:04:47	This is so informative and answers a lot of questions most people aren’t brave enough to talk about. Thank you!	5	TravelLover@825	NEW FAVORITE

2020-03-12 12:44:05	I like most of the topics, but it takes them so long to get to the topic of the podcast. I feel that there’s too much talking about other stuff. I had to unsubscribe.	3	Lmchong2	Too much excess
2020-03-10 12:04:50	I love the way this show de mystifies so many sex topics. I also love how I can pick and choose whatever topic I feel like engaging in whenever I want. This show does such great work at smashing taboos around sex. It’s how we all got here people! Let’s just drop the shame.	5	Baertank0069	Love this show
2020-03-10 04:10:29	While I enjoy all episodes from these two lovely ladies, I especially enjoyed the one around safe anal sex play. I had always felt like how much I loved butt play was wrong somehow, as none of my friends would own up to liking it or would talk about it like it was disgusting. Their show around how to have and enjoy safe anal sex was a game changer for me, and I’m so grateful! It’s such a great feeling to know that the sexy that I love and enjoy is not only acceptable, it’s amazing. Thank you for this podcast!	5	Jessica735	Changed the way I feel about anal sex!
2020-03-10 01:34:07	Sex should be fun and shameless! We should be able to let go of our inhibitions and just live and enjoy!! So for this!!	5	lala0386	Whoohoo!!
2020-03-10 01:04:06	I love these honest, necessary compassionate conversations.	5	Rebecca Rar	Love!
2020-03-10 00:58:52	This Podcast is Awesome because I have learned so much by listening to these fun girls that make everything so fun to listen too. Everything they have to teach us about sex and everything in between is great they even have workshops where you can participate and continue learning. The products they recommend like lube and toys are the best 👌🏼 they have the best sex tips and you won’t regret listening to their Podcast. If you are human and like sex and everything there is to know about it follow and listen to these girls and Thank me later 😉🤪	5	CherryGurl44	You are missing out if you ARE NOT LISTENING TO THIS Podcast!
2020-03-09 20:29:44	I see a few critical posts but ignore those rants- these are two ‘real’ women sharing invaluable information with us. Because they’re not scripted, the show is beautiful, and they clearly care about every one of their listeners. Some will nitpick, but they not only teach well, they have fun personalities. On a side note, their voices are calming and fun as well, which adds to an already excellent podcast.	5	Jimcovfootball	Real people- real life
2020-03-05 20:48:51	Episode 18 titled kink 101 has kinda ruined the shows reputation for me and made me not really want to listen to this podcast anymore. They handled a certain touchy subject in a distasteful way and now it’s hard for me to respect their views/opinions. It’s too bad because I really enjoyed their show up until that point :(	1	fattywombat	Kinda ruined for me
2020-03-03 01:34:35	Why hello beautiful souls! I drive a lot for work and typically listen to Joe Rogan to stimulate my mind. Discovering your show has led to a multitude of doors openings. Your show has made me more conscious, aware, informed, and curious. It has also made me realize a lot of my surprised issues and given me the tools to better communicate with my partner. Thank you for helping me find my libido again and my passion for learning more in this field. Much love!!!	5	Rave Bae	Eye Opening
2020-02-27 20:01:23	I was pointed to this podcast from a colleague of mine. These women really know what they are doing and offer useful info for not only sex, but relatioships and communication. Highy recommend it.	5	Aliciamaedavon	Critical info for a fun and pleasurable life
2020-02-27 17:43:09	Stumbled a crossed these erotic ladies and decided to give them a shot. Im always looking to learn and these sexy, knowledgeable ladies cover it all. Keep it up ladies you rock!!	5	joedubb76	Love these girls
2020-02-20 00:20:45	This is a must if you’re sex positive. Straight up! Lets freakin go! ⛽️	5	Gas Light Apparel	Awesome
2020-02-13 04:09:46	I LOVE this podcast. It’s truly turned me on my head. I downloaded this podcast as I was considering some sexual openness in life and literally I feel like my entire outlook on sex has changed. I feel open and excited and so set up to win! Thank you ladies for all you do, your inclusivity and your great guests who bring content from a highly educated perspective!	5	ace1237w6	Great Info: WARNING WILL CHALLENGE WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT SEX 💚💚
2020-02-11 13:25:59	These women talk about everything I want them to. They make me more confident in myself and it’s great to hear all the information and positivity about sex!! Thank you for sharing with the world	5	JJJJJJJJJJAAAAAAAAAAAA	Thank you!
2020-02-07 05:09:36	These two beautiful souls are amazing! I love that they discuss topics that people want to learn about but may be to scared or ashamed to discuss. It’s all about empowerment and living life with an open mind. I recommend this podcast to everyone! They are funny, witty, personable and of course shameless. I love that they try to be as inclusive and respectful as possible to gender and sexuality.  I hope this podcast can help people open up the way they have in my life with the information discussed in these podcasts. This is a must listen!	5	Jess Lyerla	Beautiful humans and amazing content
2020-02-11 13:23:28	I wanted to like this podcast since there are really helpful topics & I listened to a couple after fast forwarding through the first 15 minutes to get to the point. However, when they bring on someone who is telling couples in sexless marriages that their solution is to “go outside the marriage to get their needs met” or to engage in a threesome to beat boredom, I can’t listen anymore. That’s just harmful advice.	1	Jbs6135	Awful advice
2020-02-05 17:33:03	These ladies are great, and to rumbleforeskin  comment: ugh, grow up! These ladies have so much information, personally, depth, great guests, and they truly care that all listeners are included. Yes they try to be PC, as we all should. I attended a class by Amy while in Santa Cruz, and I’m so grateful for finding her and this podcast. Not only my sex life, but many aspects of my personal, and dating life have forever changed for the better! Keep up the amazing work ladies! 🥰	5	ali k san	The best podcast! Period.
2020-02-02 23:06:51	OMG, these ladies are amazing, hilarious and so much fun to listen to. They have personality and make it fun to listen to. I literally could listen to their podcasts all day (who am I kidding, I do).	5	brandi :)	LOVE THESE LADIES 👏🏼
2020-01-26 12:50:39	I’ve been married 24 years and really needed to spice things up a bit. ‘Shameless Sex’ helped take the shame/guilt off the table and get the fun and play back in the bedroom! Now we’re frolicking in our 40’s with empty-nesting naked time. Thanks Amy & April!	5	MrsQohelet	Liberating, Helpful, and Fun!
2020-01-21 16:52:04	Wow! I really love all of the topics, especially the scientific ones. I also love their personalities. They are so relatable. I want to be friends with them in real life. <3	5	Lex. Mx	Love them and the info!
2020-01-16 05:31:21	Love it! Great information! I especially like when April and Amy talk about their personal lives.	5	Liz_anaya	Awesome
2020-01-16 21:54:55	The amount of “woke” language and the explaining of it just so extreme nearly making it too hard to listen too. Practically shame a guy bc he has “girls” instead of “women” in the name of his own podcast and correcting people for suggesting sitting “Indian style” blows my mind. People come for sexualized content not a woke culture coach.	2	Rumbleforeskin	Great content....trying too hard for political correctness
2020-01-15 11:38:18	I’ve been married for 15 years (41M).  They give great advice not just for singles, but married couples as well.  Keep up the good work	5	Nmuniak	New listener
2019-12-11 16:23:40	The hosts are relatable and the guests they bring are very interesting. I gotta say, I was introduced to a lot of new concepts I’ve never heard about while listening to this podcast. Practical tips are also very useful. Some might say that the hosts get a little too personal, but I love that, their personalities give more color and character to the show.	5	tapkė	Fun and educational!
2019-12-05 11:27:43	So much education and information!!! Keep up the great work!!! 😘😘😘	5	gabesold	Awesome wonderful must listen too!!
2019-11-29 21:12:57	"I absolutely love this. I don’t tend to listen to podcasts very often, but this is my “go to” in the car! Amy and April are so real and up-front about such a broad range of topics. You can really tell they’ve done their research and have so much to offer. I look forward to new episodes every single week. Also, I can appreciate how they’ve made these sensitive topics so much easier to talk about. 

Personally, I love how they talk about their own sex lives. It makes the show much more relatable, and the sex questions they answer are always super helpful."	5	24795379226804147	So informative and entertaining!
2019-11-21 15:37:47	Broad range of relevant topics!	5	AmandaSkad	Love it!
2019-11-20 18:20:45	"Entertaining, educational and juicy:) 
I found this podcast over a year ago and look forward to the new release every week. There’s something for everyone!"	5	forwardhoe	Love these ladies!
2019-10-01 17:21:27	I like all of the information presented in this podcast. I have learned a lot listening! However the introductions and personal stories are too long. I fast forward through a lot of the beginning to get to the topic I came for.	4	lmt256	Good information
2019-11-20 13:45:48	Fun and informative and tasteful	5	AnaCocina	Love it!
2019-11-15 01:14:06	I’m a typical mid 40s married lady and if u want something to bring some spice back to your bedroom life and your relationship stop here and listen up. So many topics, so many tips, so many avenues to explore...many won’t agree but my 16-20 year olds have been told to listen, ponder and apply to their own relationships. Thanks to the Sex Chicas (the way I refer to them)!  Keep all the good stuff coming!	5	Pharm72	So much good stuff!
2019-11-13 21:58:28	Game changing advice and education! Even (and especially) for those who think they don't need to hear this kind of material. Just listen! These girls are so open and empowering about sex AND make me laugh out loud! Definitely recommend to anyone and everyone.	5	Jennybphoto	The Best Advice
2019-11-11 15:57:13	Love this pod cast. It keeps me entertained while I’m busy doing stuff that isn’t so fun!! These ladies have such good chemistry together as friends and it really shows through the pod cast!!! I have learned a lot from you two already!!! Thank you for all the hard work I know you put into making this pod cast!	5	staywoke247	Love!!!
2019-11-08 12:27:11	These ladies have changed my life. Thank you both for being who you are and everything you do. Keep up the great work!	5	mandimay1030	Amazing!!!
2019-11-07 00:05:53	This show is the perfect balance of information, introspection & light-hearted fun.  Sexuality can be difficult to talk about but Amy & April make it seem easy.  There is so much sexual shame that we have to deal with, it is entangled with our level of honesty we have with a partner, our self confidence and self love.  I’ve had too many epiphanies to count from tuning into Shameless Sex.  GREAT WORK LADIES!!!	5	bbow 73	Premium Blend
2019-10-27 03:31:37	Great job Amy and April. You two have a wonderful and fun way about discussing topics. You have fun with it and bring in lots of knowledge to the table. I catch myself listening to episodes that don’t relate to me at all, yet I stay interested. Keep up the great work	5	Zaiat01	Informative and Fun
2019-10-14 01:44:16	I love the matter of fact way that Amy and April discuss sex and sexual issues. They make a subject that is often so tabu in our society understandable and clear. Thanks!	5	KamLeitner	Great podcasts
2019-10-09 22:36:31	Very informative and quality topics!	5	LAAuren MAAy	Quality!!
2019-10-05 20:39:02	It’s really informative	5	flipebt	Great info
2019-10-05 02:34:23	I started listening to this podcast 6 months ago, and I listen to a few episodes a week. Truly, the unique variety of guests and the conversations that follow with them have cut right to the point of a lot of bs I was believing about my sexuality and the sexuality of others. It’s the sex Ed class I never had. It has enhanced my sex life by encouraging me to explore and use my voice to ask questions about what I truly want. This podcast creates space for healing. Thank you for your truths 🙌	5	gf_erickson	Healing and engaging
2019-09-08 22:11:04	"I listen to this on stitcher bc I don’t use iTunes for my podcasts but came over here to leave a review. I really enjoy this podcast bc I grew up in a super conservative environment and have never even heard of many of the things talked about on the show and I’m now 30 yrs old and married almost 5yrs 🤦🏻‍♀️
I appreciate how open y’all are on your own and the interviews you do are with such interesting professionals, love it!
I’m so glad for the uber lube recommendation, really has been a game changer 😉
My only constructive criticism would be to put time stamps on the summary thing that pops up on the screen for the episode so that I know where the interview or “actual show” starts. Like after the listener question advice thing and just chitchat in the beginning. No offense I don’t mind that but a couple times I’ve wanted to listen to the certain topic with my husband but he doesn’t wanna listen to random people he doesn’t know talk about random stuff he also doesn’t know about at the time. Idk that’s all. 
Thanks for the work you do!"	4	MsSaskie909	Fun knowledgeable topics :)
2019-10-01 12:43:09	These two wonderful woman have open my eyes and give some great advice tips and tricks. This podcast is for everyone and everyone should listen to it	5	parkelf	Eye opening
2019-09-25 19:24:20	If you’re looking to learn everything about sex, this is the podcast for you. Amy and April are courageous (you won’t believe the stuff they share), sharp, and consistently engaging. They know all things sex, too. Give it a go. I have a hunch you’ll be glad you did.	5	E119856	Great podcast
2019-09-18 17:31:22	Many of your episodes have opened my eyes to what all of this means in relationships. The core message I’ve heard is communication communication and more communication. I’ve learned so much about myself and what to expect from others. Your podcast has really been a life changer for me. I am a male and particularly learned a lot from episode #93 listening to Amy’s partner (Pipi) speak. He’s so good at communicating his feelings and experiences. I wish I could speak so eloquently. Keep up the great work guys.	5	Echogravity	Inspirational
2019-09-18 00:51:50	I grew up with 0 information regarding sex. This podcast has just completely changed my mindset about life and relationships... not just sex. These ladies are so charming, funny and honest and SO open minded. So very grateful to have this as a source to expand my knowledge, my mind and my life. Lots of love and appreciation!!	5	naivenancynolonger	Listen to this podcast!!
2019-09-12 19:55:22	I’ve listened to one episode and I have downloaded many more. Thank you ladies for tackling these relatable yet at times uncomfortable topics. You’ve brought in sexpert advice that helps to reveal solutions in a cheeky and fun way.	5	Delila808	New to the podcast
2019-09-04 13:59:11	I listen to this podcast for the majority of my day - a lot of times re-playing episodes. Truly down to earth REAL women.	5	hanwalker	Tips and information that you will actually use and remember
2019-08-22 22:35:52	A girl friend recommended this podcast after a fun night of catching up. I’ve listened to 4+ episodes currently and I love this podcast! Some episodes are structured, some are organic and all over the place, and either way they are enjoyable! I am glad podcast like this exists - that feel like a safe learning space and de-shames sex. I’m already recommending this to others!	5	Cara Ostara	Educational, Relatable, Entertaining
2019-08-18 17:26:47	I came across this podcast somewhat by accident, but I’m so glad I did. Amy and April are both truly amazing in the information they share as well as they’re attitude and acceptance of all people.	5	Ethan J Smith 24	Love you❤️. Thank you🙏🏼

2019-08-16 00:21:58	I’ve been listening for a few months now. Myself and my husband have definitely seen a great improvement in our sexual relationship. Thank you for all the amazing tips and tricks.	5	sfris87	Love these ladies
2019-08-15 04:51:03	This podcast has been so helpful. They both are so shameless towards sex hence the name of the show. They are entertaining when presenting thing but OMG the information they give. By fary favorite sexual podcast.	5	chamberedcoal	Soooooo informative and shameless
2019-08-14 23:04:54	I really love the pod cast. This show was a great lesson for me on expectations. I expected to hear about shameless flirting, rather than listening to two people shamelessly flirting. Still, it was fun to listen too.	5	TexasRed1961	Love the pod cast
2019-08-14 05:05:02	This is a great show filled with wonderful information that really helps me!! I tell all my friends about it. Listen to it because it will change you for the better.	5	ferskie	Best ever
2019-08-10 06:18:31	I’ve been on a life long journey of trying to understand sexuality and wrestling with intense sexual shame and confusion. I really think God has been healing my wounds through all kinds of unconventional avenues. April and Amy have been a legitimately real part of this process. They have been both a healing and fun presence in my life for the past year and a half. The big sisters I never had. Thank you two for helping me feel normal and comfortable being a human being.	5	Priest of Poets	Healing
2019-08-09 13:41:18	It only took about 2 minutes of the Anal August episode for me to be hooked. I love the energy! I love the tips! I love the openness!	5	Griffithaj10	New Listener and Lover

2019-08-03 19:54:06	I just recently started listening to Podcast I didn’t even know I had it lol. I asked for suggestions for a good podcast to listen too & they mentioned you. I have been listening every day on my way to work, on my way home from work, running errands or just when I get alone time while the kids are sleeping. You guys have amazing advice & have opened up a whole new world for me. I’m glad I came across you ladies & have started following both of you on Instagram. Thank you so much!	5	DaddysPrincess2k18	You ladies are amazing
2019-08-03 19:33:53	"Honest, brilliant and inspirational! I love Amy and April’s perspective on all things sex and real life. Thank you both for all your insight and sharing yourselves on this podcast! I look forward to each episode and all of your featured guest speakers! 

You are the best🖤🌟✨ thank you!"	5	star*777	Absolutely love these ladies!!
2019-08-03 03:18:09	Five star kudos to Amy and April for presenting valuable and useful information in an entertaining style. There’s always more to learn, and I do every time I listen to the podcast. Thank you to you two for breaking the code of shame on so many topics. Keep the podcast going!	5	SC Janie	Fun and informative
2019-08-02 23:43:48	Love these ladies and they keep it real. They are transparent about their own lives which makes them incredibly relatable. The show is curated nicely in terms of topics and guests which keeps my interest and I’m always learning something new. Keep up the good work	5	Kellymuse	It’s the “for reals” show
2019-07-31 20:27:47	Ladies love the show.... you two talk about all the things that people want to talk and discuss but shame themselves into not doing it. I love every single episode so much info,laughs, and woman empowerment going on in this podcast!!! Subscribe peeps and then listen learn and EXPERIMENT!!! 😘	5	Supersicfan	Real talk....
2019-07-30 23:29:47	Growing up in an unaffectionate household led to me feeling a lot of shame when it came to sexuality, sex in general, and affection of any form. Thank you for normalizing these things and for opening up conversation over topics that once pained me to talk about. I now enjoy non-awkward conversation with my partner and my friends!	5	natalie in small town MO	My favorite podcast!
2019-07-30 05:00:47	Love the openness of the hosts, and really appreciate the fantastic use of “yes, AND....” Keep up the great education and information sharing without yucking anyone’s yum. 💜	5	Pennchic6	New listener, loving the open and thoughtful conversation
2019-07-28 11:32:17	This is my fav podcast. Amy and April are smart, fun, and captivating hostesses with great discussions and guests. The podcast is always entertaining and I can always find useful information no matter the subject.	5	ColoradoCary	Great hosts and informative show
2019-07-22 07:56:50	I came across the podcast a few weeks ago and I have been been addicted to listening one after another. Thank you.	5	CostantinoA	Great Show
2019-07-19 15:26:15	Love April, Amy and the honesty they bring. I’m encouraged by how they consider their audience  and how they interview their guests. Well worth the time.	5	Voice of Experience	Great show!
2019-06-11 02:13:16	Great podcast! I’ve learned so much by listening and gotten a much deeper understanding of myself and what I want in my sex life, not to mention I’m constantly learning new things and laughing out loud listening! My one suggestion, which others have also touched on, has to do with the ads. I don’t mind an ad here and there at all, but I think it might really benefit the podcast if you put them periodically throughout each episode instead of all at the beginning. Kind of like commercial breaks. I think it would make listeners more inclined to actually listen to the ads if it was just one 2-minute promo at a time instead of a frustrating block of just ads ads ads at the beginning. Other than that you ladies are doing an amazing job and I’m always looking forward to the next podcast!!!	4	-c-c-c-c-	👍🏻
2019-07-18 17:59:08	As a happily married man, most of the information isn't good advice for marriage. Some of the guest are interesting but overall it’s okay because some of the information they share.	2	Fast Nate	It’s okay
2019-07-16 23:17:35	"These two ladies are great about encouraging people to start/have a sensual self-Love practice. I thought this was rather silly at first, but now I understand my body a lot better; and having the best sex ever with both my partners. The show has great guests that have straightforward advice and ideas. I actually enjoy and request anal sex now!
Tammy"	5	soi'mTammy	Thanks guys!
2019-07-14 02:03:20	The 2 ladies are fantastic and approach with fun and intellect!	5	dmerg59	Fantastic
2019-07-11 23:41:26	My partner introduced me to your podcast about a week ago while we were on our way to Palm Springs and we absolutely LOVED it! Not only is it extremely informational but it really opens up for great conversation. I would say that we are a very open minded couple. We have an open relationship and we practice sharing our likes and dislikes very often. On our drive your podcast was playing and we would have even more in depth conversations from what you were discussing from trying new toys you recommend, hand job positions and really focus on the details on pleasing one another (plus women to women... thank you 🙌🙌). It made for an amazing get away for the two of us and really connected us on an even deeper level. Plus who doesn’t love learning more about sex!? I haven’t stopped listening to you guys since 🧡 thank you! 👏👏	5	Pixi_gal	An even deeper connection
2019-07-10 02:39:02	i wish they didn’t take an hour to do an intro, super annoying.	2	mia094	Okay
2019-06-30 19:50:23	Love this podcast!!! I used to be a very sexual person and being in long term relationships along with experiencing some trauma, these ladies have helped me find my mojo again. They’re funny and genuine enough to listen to even if you are not necessarily listening for a purpose. LOVE THEM!	5	ShamlessSexRoxxx	Funny, Genuine, and Educational
2019-06-26 18:22:36	This was my very first podcast I have ever listened too, Amy and April are hilarious and they honestly give great tips in the bedroom. My fiancé and I listen to you at bed time and we love it!!! 💜💙	5	Chassel22	First podcast
2019-06-21 14:59:57	Thank you for all that you do!! Can't tell you how much I love your podcast. Inspiring, open-minded, and honest conversation. Thank you for helping us all bring down the walls of shame that keep so many of us from tapping into and expanding our sexual pleasure practice. You ladies rock!!🙌🏼🙏🏼💗	5	333trillium333	One of my favorite podcasts!
2019-06-18 20:52:33	Entertaining, fun and informative! It has helped me turn around my sex life and intimacy. Thank you girls!	5	duranbug2	Back in the Saddle
2019-06-18 02:16:07	I really enjoy Amy and April!  I love to hear their conversation about “the deOKa” ( watch the movie “wander lust” and you’ll understand). The girls are funny and honest. Great podcast!	5	zeiss150	Great podcast!
2019-06-18 01:57:55	I feel like after just a short time being a fan of this podcast I’ve learned so many things and opened myself up to learning more about me and partners/friends/etc. highly recommend!	5	princesspeaches23	Obsessed
2019-06-13 17:19:21	As a Santa Cruz native, I discovered Shameless Sex through Amy and her mother’s beautiful sex shop: Pure Pleasure. I discovered it when I was in the throws of some very intense sexual trauma, and it changed my life for the better in a way nothing else could. Amy and April have an incredible way of sharing their poignant wisdom while also making sexual exploration feel fun and exciting! I was so positively impacted by the podcast that I sought out one on one work with Amy, who in the span of our first consultation, singlehandedly facilitated me working through and making peace with one of the most difficult breakups of my life. I can’t wait to work with her more regularly in the future!! I recommended Shameless Sex to my current partner, who feels it has not only deepened and expanded his knowledge, but also given him great perspective on what is healthy in his own sexuality and sexuality in partnership overall. He is also in grad school, in the late stages of earning his MFT, and has recently made reference to the Shameless Sex podcast in his Human Sexuality class. Thank you Amy and April- we love you!! 💖	5	PtPHook!	Shameless Love for Shameless Sex!
2019-06-08 10:44:58	After listening to this podcast I’ve realized I was born and raised in the wrong state!! Possibly in the wrong family. I have never been more liberated in the fact that I’m not “crazy” or “weird” for being such a sexual being....especially with being a southern woman. I have recommended this podcast to so many of my friends and my husband already and I will continue to recommend anyone who might be having grown up with shaming from friends or family. I definitely have no shame now! Thank you ladies so much! Please never stop what you’re doing!	5	Brichole	Absolutely fabulous
2019-06-04 02:34:10	"Yes. Just Yes. There I sat...leaving Santa Cruz for a long drive north, worrying about falling asleep on the 6-hour trip home, when I clicked on a link that one of my longest running and best friends sent me after a weekend of somewhat fruitless car care in the BEST of company.
Shameless. 
Amy and April and their guests kept me alert and giggling and shaking my head  and learning and thinkin the whole trip. 
They Rule.
I even went and bought some Uber Lube!!
Lol
Thank you!"	5	dayandnightmockingbird	Thank you.  You cavalier humans
2019-06-06 00:32:12	Love the topics and discussions these two ladies brew up. Great intentions for communicating information that humans need more exposure to, yet I give 2 stars due to the delivery being painfully prefaced with 40% adds and repetitive chit chat. I really wanted to see these two be amongst my top podcasts after being introduced from the Kyle Theirmen show. Unfortunately after a few months of intermittent listening I cannot participate anymore. It really is painful to read such enticing episode titles and not be introduced to the content until 34 minutes in, then to hear the hosts or guests say “ we’re running out of time here but...” I felt to need to write this after I quietly tried to introduce a few friends to the channel, interested in what they might think. Everyone returned saying they had lost interest do to a ruined drive or lunch break listening to adds.	2	OtterSnacks	Constructive criticism: Content at a price

2019-04-08 06:53:51	From physically, mentally, & emotionally abusive romantic relationships the moment I became 15, the way I viewed my body and my sex life was always unhealthy. Without going into too much detail, I ended up in one too many situations where sexual acts were expected of me from my partner and it only continued into other toxic relationships I entered. I found myself turning into a woman who always initiated in an effort to put on a big erotic show, essentially. My sex drive ran off my ability to drive men of all ages into sexual pleasure, not what I actually wanted for myself physically when it came to sex. It was about having power and being in charge. Between dabbling with porn, exploring clitoral vibes (my fave) and truly exploring what feeds me sexually (and every other way really) is what helped get me where I am today. Here I am years later still looking to learn, to have open conversations, to better my sex life not only for myself but for my current partner, and of course know how to take care of myself outside of the “I just want to get off” mindset. Shameless sex has done all that and more for me. You ladies inspire the living daylights out of me to listen to my body, listen to my heart, follow and speak my own truth. April and Amy you have been nothing but a beautiful addition to my life. I cannot express enough my gratitude to live in a world where empowered, amazing women like yourselves give so much to an audience who truly wants and needs it. Thank you so much for being one of many powerful components on my personal growth journey.	5	Lash Fairy	Thanks for helping me grow.
2019-04-04 19:56:41	"Ladies, you have done a great service for an old geezer like me. Thank You. However, your obsession for political correct terms hurts my ears. If you could devise a, “short speak,” for “Female Bodied Individual, and Male Bodied Individual,” my hearing aids would fill their canals with waxy joy.
Thanks,

2019-04-05 18:07:07	My gosh. At first I liked this podcast but quickly I found myself fast forwarding through half the show. Pointless banter and bs and “enter promo code blah blah blah to get 10% off” it is non stop.	1	abbieco	Little education, mostly promos and product dropping

2019-03-28 20:22:18	"April, Amy and their wide variety of knowledgeable guests share extremely relevant info on how to get on the right track to an invigorating, intimate and mutually rewarding relationship.

The great content and advice they provide, combined with the relatable way in which they deliver it had me hooked from the very first listen - do yourself (and your partner) a favor and smash the subscribe button."	5	J. Barshop	Authentic & Empowering - A++ 👌
2019-03-21 17:54:20	I absolutely love this podcast. It's educational (as a mother to 2 young ladies...this is info I wish someone had told me 25 years ago) as well as entertaining. I appreciate the openness and honesty that this podcast brings to sexuality. As a woman who enjoys sex, it's great to learn from 2 other shameless women! Thanks April and Amy!	5	bvieting	Educational and Entertaining
2019-03-18 15:19:12	I just started listening to pod cast and I have a few. I knew going into it what these two were going to be talking about and I started listening to their previous episodes. I made it up to September 2018 and I want rip my hair out. No offense ladies but the more I listen to them the more I want to jump off a bridge. Good job you have a pod cast and a lot of followers but this follower is jumping ship to the other more lively podcasters..	1	HollywoodFlyersCA	Putting me to sleep

2019-03-13 05:02:07	If I could give more than 5 stars I would. I found this podcast over a month ago, and binge listened to all of them at work. I was sad when I caught up to the current ones. I am a 44 year old woman, married to a 32 year old man, and this podcast has changed our life. We have alway had a great sex life, but this has made me want to explore more. I’ve got my husband to listen to it now too. We even attended a Stella Harris class together, and look forward more classes in the future. If you don’t listen to Shameless Sexah you are missing out. Forever a loyal listener ❤️	5	Shelley & Richard	Absolutely Amazing
2019-03-13 03:53:06	"I’ve shared this podcasts with so many friends. April and Amy are so knowledgeable and so beautifully articulate and deconstruct this vast world of all things sex— I’m totally hooked. 
I really savor and learn so much from each episode. I love their authenticity and they often make me laugh out loud. I want to be friends with you two!! I love you both 😆 Thank you for keeping it real ♥️ you both are doing such important work in the world and so many need to hear your message.

2019-03-09 17:52:02	April and Amy are two wonderful, amazing women who are genuinely changing the world by sharing their empowering views on shameless, REAL sex. I listened to my first episode in September and I felt all the feels coming up because I just hadn’t ever had anybody talk to me about sex in this way. Since then I’ve listened to every episode (caught up mid-Jan!) and I find myself learning something in every one. I’ve already become the sex nerd among my friends and am becoming a better lover than ever (my partners like that part!). Thank you so much for everything you do. Keep doing all the thangs and making such a huge impact on all of us.	5	Me (12345666666)	Fantastic women changing the world!
2019-02-23 19:55:45	They are so awesome and amazing and funny and cute and inspiring and all the great things! I was actually recommended to listen to Shameless Sex by therapist and am forever grateful for everything my therapist did for me but this especially. I love the topics, tips, insight, and personalities of these beautiful women! Thank you for opening yourselves to us and uncovering a world of conversations we should all hear. Love love love!	5	clairbear#1	I LOVE April and Amy so much!
2019-02-13 07:21:32	After hearing most of your episodes, I am finally taking the time to write a review to thank Amy and April for sharing so vulnerably with the public about a much needed topic of conversation.    Your podcast has been so fun to listen to, and very informative.  I can feel the love and authenticity that you gals are putting into this project and it's inspiring!  Cheers to you both with my invisible glass of Margin's Wine ;)	5	Love&Colors13	Love You 2!

2019-02-01 20:34:17	Yes!  So Much good information from April and Amy here across various topics.  Today I found comfort in their words of wisdom from the early 2019 episode.  I look forward to more from April and Amy.	5	IAmHereAndIMatter	Life Changing in So Many Levels
2019-01-25 22:01:17	I saw April and Amy teach a workshop at The Oregon Eclipse Festival. I was just grabbing lunch and they happened to be teaching. What they spoke about was communication and getting into your sexual power. This was helpful in my personal life. I love them and their podcast so much! It is Informative and fun.	5	honey_diiip	So happy I saw them
2019-01-25 16:01:50	I’m a consultant that also sells intimacy products and not only is this podcast relatable in many ways, but also educational. Thanks!	5	Evlove_Evelyn	Staying a student
2019-01-19 20:43:13	I’ve been having casual sex for the first time since I was 19. I looove sex. I love talking about sex. I love sexual freedom, sexual connection. I wanted to listen to a podcast about sex but the first few I tried were boring, leaning a little too much on the educational side. I found shameless sex and within moments I was sucked in. I looove the way April and Amy speak on sex. They’re funny enough to make it feel like you’re talking to your girlfriends, but not so much so that it takes away from the educational, and meaningful conversation. I love the way they speak about sex. Relationship sex, casual sex, any, and all kinds of sex. I found my new obsession. Thank you April and Amy!	5	GMarie220	Soooo much yes.
2019-01-22 18:54:27	"I just discovered this podcast and listened to 4 episodes and really liked it until the most recent episode where they attempted to answer a question about SSRIs (antidepressants). The information they gave was totally uninformed and inaccurate and misleading and potentially dangerous. SSRIs do not cause a person to “not feel”. If you don’t even know what the medicine is (you could have at least googled what SSRI stood for before recording the episode) you are 100% unqualified to attempt to give advice about their use or side effects. For many people these are life saving drugs and your advice perpetuates misunderstanding and could deter people from seeking the help and treatment they need. 
Please don’t do this, even with the caveat that you “are not a doctor”. Or at least do a modicum of research first! Sorry, but just lost a ton of respect from me. I really enjoyed the open and enthusiastic discussion of sex and this podcast could be really good ."	2	Unhipster foodie	Good topic, bad info
2019-01-18 20:52:31	"This Podcast shares some of the most Sacred & Spiritual LOVE circulating on the Planet.  The Hosts, Amy and April, Shine the Brightest Lights into some of the Deepest Darkness and use their Voices and platform to help people Feel, Heal, Open Up & Reveal their very Hearts and Souls. They Help Remind US that life is a Celebration!!  Amy and April Educate, Empower, and Shower the World with Love, Light, Compassion, Knowledge, Wisdom & Insight as well as the Tools, Resources, information and Inspiration to Transform Our Consciousnesses, Our Hearts, and Our Relationships with Source, Self, and other Beings.

Amy and April are Two of the Brightest Lights in the Universe.  They consistently share a Consciousness, Energy, Grace, Wisdom and Love that are Beyond Time... Ancient, Sacred, Soul stirring and Spectacular.  It’s so Beautiful to see people living their purposes and the Exquisite Flow it generates for Everyone. It is Elemental, Electric, Organic and Orgasmic.  

Words are limiting and I wish I was better at communicating the depths and dimensions of Spiritual Love  (I’m working on it), and I could fully express and share just how much Amy and April mean to me, to the World and to this LIFE.  I also wish I could share, reflect, and recirculate more of their Light back to them through these words.  They both embody, emit, and transmit SO much LOVE and Joy... their exquisite chemistry, their compassion, and the Deep Love and Wonderful sense of Play that they share with each other and the World, are so powerfully and palpably Beautiful.

2019-01-11 18:42:00	I’m a monogamous, straight, married, cis white female and this podcast has expanded my knowledge immensely in the past 6 months I’ve been listening to it! I was seeking a relevant and fun podcast to listen to while doing my self-care time and this was it! I often listen while in the bath sipping on wine. I work in the field of clinical chaplaincy. Although my field very rarely overlaps with sexual education, I appreciate the holistic approaches and language used in these podcasts to help me see my patients as the complicated and pleasure seeking creatures that they are. It has increased my sensitivity as well. The personal benefits are too many to count! Thank you and keep on podcasting! I appreciate the West Coast health and sexuality wisdom we haven’t quite caught up to yet on this side!	5	Chaplain Abby	From the East Coast
2018-10-25 15:50:34	I love the professional way that these ladies speak on all kinds of interesting and helpful sex topics.

2018-12-29 22:50:49	These ladies are so down to earth, intelligent, and hilarious! This podcast has opened my eyes to so many aspects of my life I’ve been ignoring.

Asking for what you want?  What a concept!  
Telling others what we don't like?  Why don't we do this already?

2018-11-14 05:14:41	I found this podcast at just the right time in my life. I had gotten out of a long relationship and was dealing with past trauma. This podcast will help you not only feel empowered in your sexuality, but week by week helps tear down the stigma surrounding conversations about sex. I recommend this podcast to everyone and often discuss episodes with my friends. The looks on their faces when I interject with the topic of male escorts are priceless, but becomes a much more inclusive conversation than comic books, for example. April and Amy, you’re the best. Keep doing all the thangs!	5	emilou.c	Life Changing
2018-10-30 22:01:04	These two do a phenomenal job at breaking open and dissecting the taboos of sex.

2018-08-13 22:07:50	Thank you Amy and April! I stumbled upon your podcast 6 months ago and it has changed my life. I was having sex but I wasn’t having sex. What I mean by that is, I wasn’t present, I wasn’t asking for what I wanted, and I just wasn’t comfortable voicing this to my partner. All of your podcasts have helped me come out of my shell and be much more comfortable with myself and sexuality. Can’t wait to see what new podcasts you come out with!!	5	bells_8414	Life changing podcast!

2018-06-13 11:55:21	This is a great podcast to learn some new things about sex and relationships and confirm things that you may have already known. Would highly recommend to anyone in a long-term relationship or that is single in the world. The only reason I am giving four stars is because they claim that they respond to every question or survey. I filled out their survey on the website with a question quite sometime ago and have yet to receive any form of response. Other than that though, they are doing an amazing job!	4	Mic Bizzle	Awesome podcast for all sexual beings

I can’t wait to try using the techniques and dialogues shared here with my next partner. I can’t wait for every new episode and have told anyone who will listen about this show.

2017-10-09 18:37:48	This is one of my favorite podcasts. The hosts are full of energy and provide knowledge on the topics. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is that the one Amy constantly interrupts the other Amy and it’s really hard to listen to because I want to hear what has to say. I wish she would stop doing that. Other that these girls are awesome.	4	lucywho	One of my favorites

I started listening about a month ago and have made my way through all of them except anal (sadly, because it won’t play). When my 1 year old goes down for a nap, it is my shameless pleasure to listen to an episode or two. This podcast has opened my eyes to a wonderful world of what is in fact “more normal” than not. My fiancé and I get pretty wild, but now I know we can get even wilder and more connected than ever. Thanks ladies and keep up the great work!

2018-02-18 17:52:01	I only found the shameless sex podcast a month or so ago but to catch up I’ve constantly got Amy or April’s voice chatting in my ear (or one of their great and informative guests!) listening to the podcast is a great way of getting simple and fun info on sex especially on the go! I find myself wanting to send every episode to five different friends because they all have such great and helpful facts, theories or tips. I also love listening to them with my partner- a great way to bring up topics in a non confrontational way. I’m also in the beginning stages of starting up a sex info blog and listening has also given me loads of resources and motivation for that.

2017-12-10 02:10:58	Sex positive messaging is hard to do without seeming smarmy, preachy, or haughty. April and Amy have great chemistry and a wonderful directness and charm. One of my favorite podcasts...	5	fmindlin	Awesome
2017-12-06 21:45:36	I absolutely love this podcast ! I have enjoyed every episode that has aired thus far. Not only are the topics relevant to our lives, but the tone of the two ladies is dynamic. Amy brings a lot of the educational side of sex and relationships, and April brings some serious comic relief as well as vast knowledge of the toy industry. I love listening to their stories and I feel like I’m hanging out with some down to earth girlfriends. I really enjoy that this podcast covers a vast range of topics, not just about sex, but life in general. Thankyou Amy and April for making this podcast and sharing your passions with the rest of us💕	5	Breanimalstyle	Love this podcast!
2017-10-19 13:28:20	Love this podcast! I grew up very religious and had a lot of shame when talking about anything to do with sex. Thanks so much for being so open, love listening!	5	kass97	Love!
2017-10-09 20:13:32	"I am supportive of the topics this podcast strives to deliver. However, the delivery is difficult to listen follow. Every episode I've listened to so far kind of sounds like the aftermath of an overly caffeinated, stereotypical ""girl-friend"" conversation (vey distractible, lacking in structure). It's difficult to listen to when the one speaking is constantly being interrupted by the other. It's also difficult to listen to a podcaster that is so excited about the material that you're yelling and speaking really fast. It's not very captivating or easy to follow. I'm all for being silly and authentic, but perfecting the timing and being more structured in your conversations would make this a much easier podcast to listen to."	2	brigitta5280	Has potential
2017-10-02 18:37:28	These women are super inspiring. if you feel unsure about where you are at with sex they make you feel confident and happy where you are in that moment xxxxx	5	BABYGAL9	MISS
2017-09-16 06:11:02	I love listening to these ladies! They are fun and provocative. I have learned a good bit from them!	5	Fuzzyman57	Sex Goddesses!
2017-09-16 00:25:23	My partner and I have been listening to Shameless Sex for the past few weeks and have taken away a lot of great information that has made our sex Life even more rockin' than ever. Sex Life Update is hilarious not only because we know April and her partner but because Amy and April are bold, honest and SHAMELESS.	5	TheNielsen5	Love You Ladies 😘
2017-08-30 19:35:49	"What a great team! I have been meaning to check out the Shameless Sex Podcast for quite a while and I am so glad I finally got around to it. Amy & April's chemistry is effortless, easygoing, and entertaining. With fun humor and refreshing straightforwardness, these fun loving feisty foxes find fresh new avenues to fortify our own feelings and desires for openness and communication in the world of the taboo.

I finish each episode feeling informed, excited to investigate new things, and (I'm not ashamed to say) a little turned on 😈

Can't wait to hear more!

Also...

My Fan Question of the Week: 

You talk a lot about checking in a lot. ""How does this feel?"" ""Would you like more pressure?"". I feel like communication is really sexy and exciting when two people have that trust together. That said I have asked groups of my friends about this concept and the answers are usually split. Sometimes the response is just that, communication is sexy, the more the merrier. The other half seem to think those sorts of questions would kill the mood and turn them off. How do you feel about this dichotomy, and what are some ways you feel the different situations can be approached?

An idea for the suggestion box:

You mentioned Chris Ryan, and his co-authored book Sex at Dawn. I recently finished it and it has changed my life. It has offered some in-depth information on why we are the way we are sexually, and really opened my eyes in a lot of ways. Most all though, it has relieved me of an incredible amount of shame. I have always carried around an intrinsic guilt in my adult life for feeling the need to be with other people than my current partner. Because of the narrative of our society I felt like a bad person and therefore constantly was slapping myself on the wrist for just having the urges.

What do you think about doing an episode on the concepts of Sex at Dawn? Challenging the Standard Narrative and offering some insight into the types of conversations and allowance we can make with each other to function in society but also be true to our intrinsic selves. I'm wildly interested in what you would have to say!

Okay thanks for reading this novel of a comment, keep up the good work 💚"	5	Bozzy.	I love these girls :)

Trying way way too hard for sound cool, without realising its not achieved by adding swearing to every second sentence. 
While I am not saint and understand some occasions require strong language to deliver the message and emotion, it’s definitely not appreciated when someone is adding it whenever it’s possible and not possible to make it sound cooler to themselves."	3	Trying too hard and unnecessary swearing	Lerasnowflake

Anyway, I am constantly on the road due to the nature of my job and I love listening to your podcasts. They make the windshield time so much more bearable - sometimes I’m annoyed when I arrive at my appointment! I thought I knew everything about sex…I could actually have the same type of podcast BUT I’m not organized enough. Your perspective is so relatable and it’s nice to know I’m not the only gal out there who speaks and thinks frankly and honestly about sex. And with the humor needed to make me laugh out loud!

2023-05-22 13:51:56	i’ve never written a review for a podcast, but I had to for this one. This might be the most relatable host i’ve ever listen to.

2023-05-13 14:30:46	I never write reviews for podcast. This is about to change. The best way to show support and appreciation for a podcast that you learning something from is to write a review and give 5 stars. Now for my not so important opinion of this show. She does an amazing job at bringing not so spoken about topics in a non clinical way. She seems very honest and from the heart. I am sick of listening to all these clinical people out there. when she has to get clinical she does her research and goes to town with the subject making it easy to understand or brings in someone to help discuss the subject. Sometimes she goes of on rants but at the end it ends up being funny or illuminating in some way.	5	From the heart	Ademan12
2023-05-04 16:14:53	What is not to love about THH and Jordyn?! She’s funny, she’s direct, and she presents some great info. I feel like Jordyn could be my BFF with how candid she is and her sense of humor. She literally has me cracking up while listening to her podcast! Not only is she funny, she helped up my Sex life from maybe once a month to 5x/week! And the products she promotes 🤤! Not only has everything I’ve tried been superb, the discount codes are clutch! I have yet to be disappointed with THH in any way!	5	Favorite Monday podcast!	Em0862

2023-04-29 15:04:15	I am a 75 year old married male. I think you are hilarious. I like your language and the unusual use of your words. I can use little of your advice because my partner will not communicate well. Nonetheless I like your program.	5	Good job jordy!	Jimmy G One

2023-04-06 21:10:26	I’m pretty sure Jordyn & I would be mildly toxic besties. Lol love her and love this whole show. It’s exactly what married / long term / all couples need to hear. Monogamy is not boring , it only is if you let it get that way. Listen to mama J, ❤️ you gurl!	5	Yes, yes and so much more yes!	AngieRez
2023-04-08 16:06:57	At first I thought she was funny, but realized after a number of episodes that while she may be knowledgeable about sex, she is just a grown up version of the mean girl from high school. She make comments to the effect that some people aren’t worthy of good sex, which shows her lack of maturity. For example: women who don’t want to be penetrated anally, overweight people, people who have to use a CPAP, women who don’t always wear makeup, women who fart in front of their men, etc etc. Her comments are hurtful to normal people who may just want to improve their sex lives without judgment or difficult standards.	1	A mean girl in sexually enlightened clothing	Dulcinea14tx
2023-04-03 19:55:52	Jordyn makes it so funny! So knowledgeable and humble about things. Listening has helped my marriage in every way. In the bedroom, as a parent and as a husband! Thank you for your time and effort!	5	So fun and informative	Grateful Husband0001

2023-03-31 17:06:14	I’m LOVING The Horny Housewife podcast! The topics and discussions are honest, edgy, educational, and a blast to listen to! They are based on REAL sex-related issues, questions, and concerns that many people are dying to talk about, but are afraid to. Jordyn puts it all out there and tells it like it is with her bubbly personality and fantastic sense of humor. She is definitely someone I’d love to have in my friend corner! Applause for The Horny Housewife pod!👏👏👏👏👏	5	Honest, edgy, and FUN!	Monica-G-n-Texas
2023-03-30 11:48:56	She is fun to listen too! Also a very exotic voice that she doesn’t like…🤷🏼‍♂️👍🏻	5	Da bomb dot com!	rtorsell
2023-03-27 09:38:50	"I love the candid authenticity. Jordyn described herself as the big sister. Very true. Tell it like it is. I left this episode feeling like I had quietly been taken aside and given solid advice and opinions friend to friend. I relate firsthand to a lot of the show. 
I love the “consider this” approach. I’m sharing this podcast with my lover/best friend/partner and letting her know I can’t wait to kiss her."	5	Super duper fun listen	Mathies Truth
2023-03-19 00:34:59	Hilarious, sexy, and mildly toxic. I’m here for it!!!	5	If you’re curious, give it a listen…	AnchieB
2023-03-27 04:17:54	I tried, I really tried multiple times, but she is so hard to listen to at times, and the other times, she comes across as a typical privileged white woman who is so judgmental. Her ability to completely just drone on is also quite annoying. Some of her personal stories are both good and juicy, but she also promised to keep them “short” in her early episodes, but they did not last long. Overall a tough listen, but not the absolute worst podcast ever.	1	HARD TO LISTEN TO	thatdude2008

2023-03-13 11:54:31	Jordyn is my people! I love the way she talks to her audience as if she’s the semi-inappropriate relative at the family party who you chat with in the corner of the room over a glass of wine, laughing and eye rolling but also giving the advice you really need to hear. I love the topics and the listener questions and I look forward to the new episode every week!	5	Amazing	mamalovesnova

2023-03-02 15:48:36	This podcast encouraged me to have hard conversations with my husband. It’s amazing how just having a conversation about sex, or anything in our marriage that is bothering me can really help solve issues. Can we just normalize communicating in general with our spouses?!? Honestly, this podcast is such a breath of fresh air. I love how real Jordan is and she tells you like it is, what people in marriages really need to hear. Thanks Jordan!	5	Marriage saver	Jellibelli929
2023-03-02 04:14:08	I love this woman! She does this show solo and she doesn’t need anyone else!

2023-02-22 01:15:44	"Jordyn is my bestie and she doesn’t know it 😂
I’m always listening & learning- she’s like talking to a best friend. 

Podcast has changed my life. Not just sex- but how I think about sex, marriage, being INTENTIONAL. Wish I had known what I’ve learned sooner but grateful I know now
Has helped me be more confident, more adventurous, more loving, patient, accepting, I could go on and on. 

Plus there are so many laughs in each episode- Jordyn is truly gifted. Not many people can hold a podcast solo for an hour and she nails it every time."	5	Best podcast ever!	DJ fluffy paws

2023-01-08 22:36:27	I recently found this podcast and I love it. My wife and I have been married for 10 years, we have four kids and our sex life is, overall and considering the kids, really great. I was looking for a podcast that would help me level up my bedroom game and better understand the nuances of my wife’s pleasure interests. I have found good advice in these areas from THH podcast and so much more. Even after ten years, I’m still learning new things about this woman I love and this podcast is helping me with that journey. I also really enjoy Jordyn’s humor. How can you have some of these conversations and not chuckle a little? There are only five stars to give, but this show really is a 10/10. Thanks so much, Jordyn!	5	The Grateful Husband	Stogen

2022-12-18 01:57:33	I don’t know why I listen to this podcast. Jordyn is weird and sometimes maybe too high? But I like her. She is genuine and reminds me of girls I went to high school with that are still living in my hometown. But Jordyn is smarter than them, and she is a lot more open to exploring sexuality than they are. She does a good job.	5	Chef’s kiss?	mpaunovich

2022-10-23 11:26:17	"I hate this show… it’s terrible, I can’t believe I listen to it…. Why you ask? 

Because my wife was working on a similar show about 5-7 years ago, but with young kids and a busy life, there was no time, and she just threw in the towel….

That being said, I hate the show because Jordan was able to beat us to it. And while I’m sure my wife’s show would’ve been great, it’s time for real talk..

This is a truly great show. Jordan is carefree, realistic, relates incredibly well to millennial and Gen Z couples, and her brutal honesty is truly refreshing. I’ve listened from roughly episode 75 to 100, and my wife is also now 100% bought in! She enjoys listening on dog walks and I know that each week that she listens, our night will end well….

Thanks Jordan for your great, entertaining, and refreshing show! 5 stars in my household!"	5	Read the full review….	Bratman2597

I’m 43 & my boyfriend is 50 and he admires my confidence and I admire him being a MAN!!! So many people now days have the perception that acting like a man equals a man being over controlling and/or abusive. I am domestic violence survivor so trust me I know the difference! I spent 25 years in abuse. My guy is a man’s man, former marine, gun toting southern man who enjoys pegging and having facials with me! Thank you for finally saying what tons of us are thinking!

2022-09-08 11:50:43	Had to unfollow after one too many self-proclaimed “mildly toxic” bits of advice that will no doubt do more harm than good. This podcaster’s only qualification for giving advice about sex is that she likes sex. That’s it. It’s not evidence-based advice. Giving two stars instead of one because her overall message of connection via sex is sound and she’s got the guts to put it out in the world. However, she needs to be better informed about her topic before doling advice.	2	“Mildly Toxic” isn’t funny or cute… it’s harmful	Love-It-or-Leave-It
2022-09-03 17:07:01	Jordyn’s personal brain clearance, therapy session/podcast is so entertaining, funny, and educational you will easily envelope yourself into her crazy winding roads of stories that she shares. I recommend starting from episode #1 and watch her amazing podcasting development.

It’s great for women but amazing for guys, like the secret way to understand how woman think! I love listening, really makes my day better! I wish this sort of podcast had been around 16 yrs ago when I was a new mom and a wife!	5	Fantastic and Awesome!	WWOW@5401

2022-04-26 13:33:56	I found this show around episode 9 or 10. Ever since, I have listened to every episode every week. Love the diversity of point of views as well as the the diversity in f topics and listener questions. My wife has even taken up listening every week. I played an episode in the truck with her while going away for a weekend trip and she was hooked. Love the show and I look forward to seeing the topics get deeper. This has without a doubt helped me in my self development and being even more aware of my actions and helped me with being intentional in our relationship.	5	Listener since day 1	H Willey

2022-03-14 20:02:25	This was my first “sex podcast”. I started reaching out to the pod world and was surprised to see so many available channels. This was my first sex ed pod and after downloading other shows it’s my only one remaining on my list. Incredible show that’s very informative for all parties. You’ll get some good laughs in while learning. All of the questions and conversations I’ve always wanted to have with my partner are on this podcast. I used to think I was some type of freak and the more I listen the less I feel alone in the sex world. Thank you for all the amazing information and keeping me interested. I look forward to Mondays for one. Can’t wait to see what the future brings.	5	Helpful, fun, a must listen for anyone 18+.	Alan Baird Project

2022-03-10 00:38:30	I don’t know why sex (especially married sex) is such a taboo subject, but I’m glad Jordyn had the nerve to address these topics!

2022-02-10 00:19:35	My wife and I loved the podcast Call Her Daddy back when it first came out! Way more for singles though, no real married perspective! Jordyn brings Call Her Daddy to marriage and  relates it to the ups and downs of marriage!	5	Married Call her Daddy!	Eags41

If you want to laugh,fantasize, learn, and explore anything about sex this podcast is for you! In Am a active Mormon/Christian man and this podcast has helped my spouse who is more conservative/closed minded  to sex and trying new things.

I never believed Church Boy...now I feel extra bad about all of this. You’re wonderful this podcast is hilarious. Just so you know sometimes before I go to bed I think about that night and I cringe. I remember things a little differently, but one correction, Church Boy and I were 2 years apart not 5 lol.	5	Funny and relatable..maybe too relatable?	scarahboness
2021-04-21 17:40:20	My favorite podcast to listen to while driving. It’s like having a juicy convo with your best friend. Real, authentic, relatable, and absolutely hilarious.

2019-10-29 20:58:24	I have been listening to the show now for over a year, and can honestly say it has helped to save my marriage. I had put work ahead of my marriage for many years, leaving it to fall apart.

2014-09-18 22:04:17	Seems to be 80% general chat about anything other than the title of the podcast mixed with advertising and the rest ok content you could probably Google and find better info on. Sorry guys but after listening to around 50 episodes, it's getting tiring.	2	mattkaus	Very slow going
2010-08-02 11:56:21	What's not to lover about Emily and her sidekick Menace, a great and informative show with great discussions.	4	K-Mac2170	I love Emily !!!
2014-08-11 04:30:54	You have given me so much advice and help! Now I feel like a much stronger and knowledgeable female. Thank you!	5	KerrySJ	Thankyou!
2014-06-01 06:03:54	If you've got lots of time then this might be OK.  There is maybe 5 to 10 minutes of good content hidden in 50 to 60 minutes of 'fluff'.  I have subscribed and listened for about a year, and it's getting worse, not better, unfortunately.	2	EasyRiding Eagle	Too wordy and unstructured
2013-11-13 20:42:57	Spends more time pushing her own products than talking about anything relevant. Feels like its at least half the show.	1	Theknightone	Disappointing
2013-06-20 08:11:07	Emily is ditsy and haphazard and often loses track of what she's talking about. The podcast is long, drawn out and tedious. I feel it has a lot of filler. The actual hard and fast content is great, when they get to it, but all the other junk is in the way...	2	Raz24567890544	Half marks
2011-05-17 13:16:57	I love Emily she I so good at talking I just can't get enuf of her I love her the so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much	5	Hotstud91	Emily is the best
2010-08-23 03:09:28	"Good series of podcasts. Not smutty (good).

More interesting when Emily has a guest who can speak from experience, rather than when Emily relates stuff she has read up about.

Menace is an eclectic combination of extreme naqrrow mindedness to some very broad minded things.

Keep it up (even though we know you dont read the reviews here....)"	5	Davidlaurence	Good podcasts
2010-08-20 03:33:37	Love this podcast. Informative and I love Emily....no topic is off limits.	5	Goofalot	Love it!

2011-03-08 01:42:03	Great show	5	Likely like	Like
2023-07-21 06:01:31	I have listened to Dr. Emily off and on for a couple of years. There’s a reason I always come back to her. Yes, there’s an off part to my first sentence, but that’s mostly because I listen to music and podcasts with different content. Whenever I want to explore my sexuality, my sex life, or I am working on my path of continuing to become a better lover, I turn to her. My wife has begun learning from her as well. We have an amazing sex life but there’s room for growth in every aspect of one’s life and relationships, that includes our sex lives. I want to encourage you to find a podcast topic that appeals to you and give it a listen. I promise you’ll be back for more. Thank you Dr. Emily for your never ending desire to help people live a more pleasure filled life!	5	mikeschoon1976	Perfection
2023-11-24 18:24:05	I like this pod! Some of the advice is questionable (like don’t tell your partner you’ve cheated if you’re ready to go to therapy and change) but overall I like it	3	katieg1736	Good!
2023-07-22 18:32:52	"The host is lovely and clearly knowledgeable as per time and space. But the advice makes me feel sad. Why link the romantic gestures or atmosphere, cuddling, massage and chit-chat with sexual desire? Does a teddy bear make people turned on?? Why expect people, especially men, to simply agree to talk? Talking is crucial. But many simply wouldn’t talk no matter what backflips you perform.

I am starting to suspect it’s the North American approach that makes me sad. I come from Europe and am discovering, while not believing my ears and eyes, just how prevalent the puritanical background is here. Undercover. It’s either people are awkward with simple things like even acting flirty or turning you on with the way they look at you, or simply talking about sex, or it’s the opposite - so much interest in porn and extreme exploration. Where is casual flirt? Where is natural eroticism? Not in-your-eye garters or barely there leggings but flirty, playful, making-you-wonder clothes? Why sex is such a taboo topic? It’s part of us, our lives. Sigh. I am so sorry people suffer."	3	Dee4509	Sad
2023-07-19 22:52:03	This is hands down one of the best sexuality podcasts out there. Dr. Emily is knowledgeable, fun to listen to, and very entertaining. Highly recommend this podcast!	5	Walkietalkie000	Sex With Emily
2023-03-24 14:37:43	I absolutely love this podcast, I listen in daily on different episodes and the knowledge that it gives me, makes me want to make my relationship even better!!!	5	Nl porter	Love your podcast
2023-06-14 00:04:26	Love Dr. Emily and have been a listener for years. One piece of advice would be to stop associating with the GGE podcast. They love stereotypes, making light of sexual abuse, lost count of DUI jokes… please stop giving them a platform.	4	yiiiiiikeeees	So good
2023-05-07 16:11:55	Good show but stopped listening after the constant referral to people by their genitals. Felt very demeaning.	1	xoApril	People with vulvas
2023-04-09 16:56:38	i used to listen to this podcast religiously until emily started plugging things like penis enlargement when someone calls in thinking their size is too small. she slips it into conversation without stating it’s a clear ad. she does this often with many things but this is the most alarming. how much to you get paid every time you mention the company, emily? also increasingly concern about your lack of consideration/language/research outside of the cis hetero lens. for a sex researcher, you’re extremely behind.	2	B123oo	hmmmmm
2023-03-31 01:19:36	I love her content, but she doesn’t let anyone finish ONE SINGLE SENTENCE!!!! If she could actually let people finish one sentence, we might learn	1	Paloma hdzz	Love the content, terrible interviewer

2021-11-17 18:48:50	Too bad the exuberant host twists your brain and makes advice confusing by not saying man or woman. Surely men and women are the most usual suspects having sex.	1	Jaympols	Awkward
2021-08-29 05:36:10	This podcast has helped me communicate well, release sexual shame, and embrace my own pleasure. I recommend it to all my friends!	5	Emm9117	L O V E

2021-04-25 00:07:12	This podcast is so helpful and I love Emily’s energy and intelligence. I truly look forward to each episode and have learned so much from this podcast and as someone in their early 20s it has helped me to gain a healthy relationship with sex.	5	ontario97	LOVE IT SO HELPFUL

2021-03-11 04:30:17	Love Sex with Emily! Emily is so knowledgeable, provides great advice and insight for listeners! I have learned so much since I began listening to this podcast 3 months ago! I have told all of my friends about this podcast and encourage them to listen!	5	:D 11	THE BEST!!
2021-03-09 04:45:32	So glad I stumbled on this podcast - super enjoying listening to new eps and catching up on old. Love Emily’s energy, outlook, and way of making such a weirdly taboo topic feel as normal as it should.	5	D-Pot	Happy thank you more please!
2021-03-02 13:12:15	I learned so much , from Emily  and my sexuality and my relationship with my partner, we’re going great. !	5	natie_boo	Great job
2021-02-09 02:22:38	Super grateful to have this non filtered information about sex and vaginas and penises. Thank you for your work and sharing the knowledge!	5	m-lou82	Thank you

2019-10-23 23:28:59	In a few words, Hearing Emily stepped up my relationship with my wife not only  sex wise but also in our communication  :)	5	JorgeCherem	Amazing !
2019-09-18 11:43:03	This podcast has grown so much in the 6 years I’ve been listening and I always take away something new. Emily speaks in a way that is open without being crude about sex, exploration, toys and everything else. I cannot recommend this podcast enough. I strive to be “that friend” in all my social groups that starts the sex conversation because we need to have it to have better sex! And Emily, your goal of a lube on every nightstand will come true ✨	5	Maggie Sheila	The best education and conversation starter
2019-09-05 02:20:07	"Often times the answer that I don’t hear is - “relax, You are loving...”. Remind people that they are conscious in the way they want to be good and safe and open and exposed. 

The delayed guy call... that woman was so bound up in her negative self talk. It’s not a doctor. It’s letting her chill out and enjoy. And for her to enjoy reassurance in saying, “oh darlin, I’m so happy, you’re wonderful and I like you”"	5	desri	Your show is great.
2019-08-15 09:49:34	A high-energy, intelligent and refreshing podcast.	5	PJWlistening	Great podcast
2019-06-19 02:11:12	Emily’s podcast is outright amazing. She approaches all topics with such positivity and honestly and does so in a fun an professional manor. There is so much you can learn from this podcast, both relationship wise and as a single person and there’s tons of sex and self love information too! This is one podcast you should definitely listen to if you enjoy sexual or romantic relationships or just want to better your sex life!	5	Rivinn	Such an amazing podcast!
2019-03-26 04:59:15	Finally! a podcast where you can learn new tricks in the bed either for you alone or you & your partner & about relationships in general & how to make them last. Loved Dr.Ruth growing up, but Eily is a breath of fresh air with a new prospective, similar to that of a true friend.	5	Crimson_Star	Finally
2019-03-12 16:27:05	I’ve been listening for years now and Emily is always informative and she brings in great guests! She’s helped me realize my potential in relationships and in bed! I’ve also downloaded her Kegel camp app!	5	tslav110011	Great sex advice podcast
2019-02-10 11:44:36	I love the intro to the show first off. I listen to the whole thing every time. Emily understands and accepts everyone no matter what their beliefs. She helps my relationship daily and we need more people like her in this world.	5	Stene19	So helpful
2018-11-21 17:30:31	Sex positive and covers a vast array of topics. So grateful she's discussed sexual pain such as vulvodynia and vaginismus in past episodes. Gives amazing sex and relationship advice. Lots of advice for women with libido and orgasm issues. Could use more LGBTQ content (but I'm not complaining).  Emily is a goddess of sex education!	5	gobanana75	Amazing!!!!
2018-08-22 02:38:39	My husband and I just recently started listening to this podcast and we really enjoy it. Some episodes are better than others (but what podcast isn’t like that?!?) Emily has great advice and tips. And most importantly it’s making sex a “normal” topic of conversation for us! Which does nothing but help our sexlife!	5	A.M.E	New Listeners!
2018-07-14 00:24:20	This is the first time I’ve ever left a review for anything in my life, but that’s how much I love this podcast. I think in this day and age a lot of people are so scared to talk about sex, intimacy and what really truly pleases them. This podcasts helps you step into your true sexual power and find confidence to get what you want in bed. I also love the educational component of the podcast there is a lot of things I didn’t know about even my own body!! Now I know I’m not alone having certain questions about my body and pleasing my partners. Emily is fun and has a carefree attitude that makes you want to keep listening! Love love love!	5	jackie653	Worth binge listening to!!
2018-04-01 03:52:45	Obsessed with your podcast Emily!!!! Xox	5	*Ky*	Sex with Emily is my FAV
2017-10-30 02:23:03	Sex with Emily is a great podcast packed with useful information on sex, relationships, and life. Powerful messages that promote mindfulness, positive self image, personal growth and so much more. Keep up the great work Emily.	5	JeffGrantham	Real, practical, useful and fun
2017-10-07 16:59:20	Listening to Sex with Emily is one of the very best ways to develop an extremely important aspect of being human. Thank you Emily and all your guests.	5	TToTie	Sexual Development

2017-07-06 22:16:02	"Hi Emily! 

I never leave comments anywhere, that's how much I love your show! 

My partner and I both listen (separately) and often talk about things you've mentioned. 

You've made it easier for us to talk about our wants and needs in the bedroom and out of it. 

Thank you for everything ❤️"	5	Jillygirl22	My favourite podcast
2016-11-30 22:27:05	I have been listening to Emily and Co. for a few years now and have found it to be enjoyable and enlightening.	5	ZenMaster117	Keep up the good work
2016-10-07 15:38:47	"Emily,
My dear you have changed my sex life in the best way possible. Your podcast has helped to teach me just how important sex is in a relationship. Both my boyfriend and I thank you immensely!

2016-07-20 10:54:22	Fantastic job Emily, you are tha bomb !	5	Jyle	What's not to love
2016-07-10 03:51:59	Lots of good info and rarely annoying. Gets a bit repetitive if you listen to them in a condensed timeframe, so I'd like them hear them go more into left field with topics.	5	whyioughta222	Anderson rules, menace drools
2016-07-09 16:35:24	Great to listen to on road trips, Emily's products are awesome for mixing things up in the bedroom. Anderson is hilarious and Emily is sweet and charming and teaches you how to properly express yourself to get what you want out of your relationships. Big fan!	5	Brendan_hos	Great listen for those looking to spice things up
2016-07-09 05:13:21	"I have been listening to Emily's podcast since the first time I heard her as a guest host on Loveline. Those were always my favourite. She really has a lot to offer to listeners, especially those who are uncomfortable with the subject of sex. It is such a huge part of being human but so taboo. She is a strong woman people should look up to.

5 Stars for Emily."	5	Someonetookmyothername	Rocking'it.
2016-06-16 22:38:58	Great content, I listen twice a week. It's free!	5	Tybot99	You might learn something
2016-07-05 22:59:41	"Travel a lot and some places unable to get local radio. So downloaded all the episodes. This show does have some good advice and some bad advice. Shows promotes infidelity though. So be cautious with following advice. Also one of the co-hosts Menace has some serious sexual issues and should seek concealing for his own issues and not offer advice. 
Married when I was 21 and now at 34 with the same great girl. According to the show this doesn't work. And we never had sex or lived together before we were married either. 
So to others you are normal if you have been faithful to one person. 
Emily and Menace are not great people to take advice from as their own relationships do not work."	1	RSCK	Ruining Marriages One Podcast at a time.
2016-07-03 16:22:27	Love it, Emily is lovely but she talk too fast and jumps all over the place:) I do love her though	4	Jann2015	Awesome
2016-03-03 04:26:41	she is amazing!!! by far my favourite podcast!!	5	isagaudet	PURE GOLD
2015-10-22 13:55:28	Love listening to your podcasts and advice! Been doing Kegel camp ever since I started listening also. Keep them coming, you always manage to keep it interesting and funny and insightful all at the same time! Love it!	5	VeroSam15	Awesome
2016-01-31 14:03:33	It's a good podcast, but the actual talk of sex and advice of sex/relationships, is in between banter that the listeners don't know anything about. I usually just skip over all that and get to the listener questions and the o.k answers they receive back	3	Collybears	Good
2015-10-14 11:40:56	Best show ever! Learn something knew every time I listen!	5	AndiKate3	Sex with Emily
2015-10-06 21:14:54	Emily is so funny and entertaining. I love listening to this podcast and I've learned so much, it has bettered my life and has even made me more confident :)	5	Nj2162	Love!
2015-10-13 17:56:38	"The fact that people would (even be bothered to) consider writing negative comments about something that is free, should speaks volumes about it's adequacy...  

Instead of just walking away after a listen, I had to hear a few more in order to confirm that the show IS in fact THAT BAD! 

Almost the entire show is uninspiring personal banter with borderline with OK news stories and lame ads thrown in.  Toward the end of the show, the attractive topic is finally covered (in a very broad sense) before wrapping up.  

At this point, the feeling of surprise makes you check to see if its really over.  It is, so then the disappointment really sets in and the bewilderment about the positive reviews.  Are they even real?"	1	Mad77Turtle	It's a time swindler
2015-09-26 05:56:53	This show offers a lot of great advice and the hosts are easy to listen to.	5	Bassdemon73	Great Podcast
2015-06-22 13:50:03	Love listening to Emily twice a week. Have learned some great tips and tricks. Emily is great.	5	Shedevil18	Love it
2015-01-03 00:31:42	This truly is the best podcast. I like to listen to people who are honest and genuine. I have learned a GREAT deal from Emily, Menace and Anderson. You guys rock keep up the good work. FYI this is my first review I have ever written.	5	Amanda EN Good	The BEST podcast
2015-06-15 05:15:42	I began listening to this hoping for an interesting podcast, but instead received a podcast that was extremely off topic. Emily puts a title on her podcast, then talks about it once or twice in the entire podcast. I do not recommend at all.	1	CalicoKitty0209	Awful.
2015-03-13 15:45:03	"Vapid, shallow, judgemental and filled with sponsor ads left and right. I'd caught up with all Sex Nerd Sandra episodes when I decided (for the second time) to give SWE a shot. I regret it. Honestly, there's not a good bit of advice given other than her broad ""couples should communicate more"" statements. Does Emily even have any experience in the field of sexology? Doesn't seem like it. Save yourself the trouble and check out Sex Nerd Sandra instead."	1	Miwakou	Not what it should be...
2014-10-21 15:08:56	Sex with Emily is 1 of my top 2 favorite podcasts!!  Emily gives great relationship and sex advice has awesome guests and amazing and honest sex toy reviews!!  I have taken her advice and bought some of the toys she has recommended and it has made me and wife very happy people! :)  I get so excited when i have a new show to listen to and she just has the cutest voice ever!!  I hope Emily will come to Canada soon so I can meet her and tell her how fabulous she is!!	5	Bigdladykiller	Amazing Show
2014-08-11 03:29:52	"From Newfoundland, Canada. My husband and I love your show. It's great. We just drove a long way to visit my parents and it kept us awake and intrigued. Xoxo. Very informative. Menace is great as well but you are the "" hostess with the most(ess)"" ;) 👍👍  Keep up the great work."	5	Seona64	Love it!!!
2014-08-10 17:38:13	You've said to leave a review and I just want to say, that your podcast is the best for sex and relationship advice! Your voice is nice and soft to listen to! I also bought your book and has helped me and my relationship a lot! :) thanks and good job! Keep up the great work	5	Llib3rty	Great podcast! Thanks for all the help!
2013-12-30 22:06:56	I really enjoy the chemistry between Emily and Menace. Have been listening to the pod cast for awhile and it just keeps getting better and better.	5	Walker_19	Best sex podcast
2014-08-02 17:27:20	"The first SWE podcast episode I listened to was ""Her Orgasm"" and it completely enlightened me (even though I already have a very healthy & positive views of sex and masturbation!). I recommend everyone listen to that ep.! I now love the show and really enjoy Emily's dynamic with the hilarious Menace! Keep up the great work!... you are changing lives one orgasm at a time."	4	Canadian-girl-Nene	Love the show!
2011-08-28 04:07:42	"I  love this podcast! I download this for work and I always laugh so hard at work people wonder what I am laughing about. The chemistry between Emily and Menace is great.

I also think Menace is so hot and funny I love his honest opinons...I would definitely have fun with him. I wish there were more pictures of him.

Anyways Great show People.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

Thanks and stay sexy,

2013-06-25 19:43:23	I just started to listen and i found out that this show is so educative and entertaining as well. Love you Emily.	4	Love on the sky	Awesome!!!
2013-05-29 15:48:06	The commercials for sponsors isn't that bad. What's boring and pointless is Emily and Menace talking about their daily personal lives and what they did on the weekend.  No one cares	1	Gixxer5000	No real content anymore
2013-04-02 18:21:02	Apparently, this Podcast is pretty popular. After listening to an episode, I'm not sure why. The amount of blatant product advertisements is ridiculous. I probably heard only 15 minutes of actual content. While talking about men lasting longer, she started plugging products that would increase stimulation and cause men to orgasm faster. Seriously? The contrast between this fluff and the Savage Love Podcast is striking.	1	a_____j____	Night and Day
2012-11-03 19:50:02	"Emily, we get it, you have sponsors, and sponsors fund your show. But please, we don't need to listen to you ""talk"" about (insert service/product/etc) and your ""experience"", when it's clear you're being payed to include this in your show. Give them 30 seconds, thank them, then move on. (it doesn't help that your ""comments"" are factually incorrect at times -- no, your streaming podcast service does not have every podcast available...)

Show used to be a lot better, and I hope it can return to former glory."	1	unclewilly001	Big advertisement with some content
2012-06-19 16:36:03	Savage love is way superior in its quality of advice, this is a very shallow reality show obsessed version of savage love..	1	BrandonRedd	..
2010-11-19 00:00:49	"Out of all the gazillion podcasts out there... Sex with Emily is consistently the smartest, most informative, and most entertaining program out there!
The natural chemistry between Emily and Menace is perfection.. Even though Menace is often wrong. ( sorry dude, handjobs are amazing and horny never stopped being hip)"	5	Hundie	If you aren't listening? You have no excuse!
2010-10-03 13:17:17	I don't usually stop and write reviews, but Emily your show is the best! Love it and keep up the good work.	5	Maria_fav	Excellent !!!

2020-11-25 12:59:12	I recently started lo listen to this podcast and it Has really being an eye opener and the most importantly is that it makes me feel understand because as the topics that you talk are taboo, usually people don’t talk about it so when you listen to this you realize is really common and you are not alone :) thank you Emily	5	tmejiasm	Must listen to

2019-08-07 06:44:30	Love this podcast, really informative, the only reason I gave 4 stars is because there’s a tendency to talk over guests and people who phone in when they’re trying to explain their situations. Other than that, awesome!	4	610978	Great!

2021-08-25 06:11:07	I think the podcast tackles good topics , the host needs to learn how to give her guests a chance to complete full sentences without talking over or interrupting them.	3	Sindbad79	Talking over her guests

2016-07-30 00:32:36	"I first started listening last year when I was a student all I had was a phone, living on a boat with no electric in the freezing cold.
Emily’s uplifting and reassuring manor cheered me up and I’ve been listening ever since.
I am constantly inspired by Emily and her show.  The guests, inc Menace are top and so much fun that I’d like to meet them all one day.  The ads are seamless and sometimes funny too,  I’ve tried listening to other podcasts, but listening to Emily is like hanging with you best friends =)"	5	SwarmStudios	Aways fun, informative, and joy to listen to..
2016-10-12 17:40:50	"Good podcast and good advices to come back to from time to time but it gets repetitive so I can't listen to all the episodes released.
Sometimes I have trouble to focus on what Emily's guests says because she interrupts them. 
Quite frankly I can't stand Mr Menace (a regular on the show) and his know-it-all attitude and find him disrespectful sometimes."	3	Ohlalab	good advices but...

2017-01-02 13:53:21	Barely touches the subjects in the title. All three episodes I listened to were -way- less intellectual/smart than it would have to be to entertain anyone who has not been listening for years...	1	Martine Forsberg	Superficial

2016-04-28 07:00:32	The product placements just killed this podcast for me. Too much chatter, too little content. It could have been so good. Disappointed.	2	fanofhistory	Brilliant concept but not well carried out
2014-03-24 07:34:24	Till och med Emily lär sig nya saker av hennes gäster, då finns det nytt att lära för oss alla. Underhållande diskussioner och bollande av idéer där de delar med sig av erfarenheter kring sex samt nya rön. Keep it up Emily & Co!	5	aktoth	Något för alla

She has a great erotic sounding voice and listening to her talk about all aspects of her own and her guests sex lives will have you hooked. It's a fast moving, hi-octain, action packed 3 hour worth of who's doing what to who, where, when and how offen and you should be to, so don't miss another show.  / Steven"	5	Calling From Sweden	Titilating, Sexy, Erotic with the wonderful Emily
2022-01-20 19:36:17	I love to listen to this podcast, and the car ride back home is perfect time for it. Dr. Emily is direct, and I like she is t romanticizing sex, but actually talking about it in a realistic way. And her inputs are really good	5	Eve 1971	Perfect for a car ride
2017-07-07 05:12:30	Just came across this podcast recently and I'm already addicted to it. Keep up the good work!	5	Fr1bor	Amazing and educational podcast!

2023-12-01 18:54:07	Emily is a great host. Lots of variety of sex advice, Q&A, and very open to all relationship types. Just found the podcast recently but trying to go back to check out a ton of missed episodes	5	Shananorama	Great podcast
2023-11-04 13:55:25	Wish there were more than 2 a week.	5	compact8	Been listening to Emily for years. Enjoy every episode.
2023-10-15 01:40:15	"Emily, It’s obvious that you totally prepare for every one of your shows. You Must Have Some Daily Missions To Make Each Show Entertaining Memorable and More Inviting.   
How you professionally manage/conduct, and communicate/listen to everyone is impeccable. It’s Obvious that you put in Continuous Effort in what you do.

2023-11-02 17:54:37	I could only tolerate listening to her slurred speech for a couple episodes and listened to an episode or 2 that were not slurred, so I’m done taking that chance. And realized in those episodes she really just loves to plug her sex toys. Annnnd, the whole “doctor” thing seems super sus.	2	Jcurndidnfmxk	Interesting topics, but….
2023-10-30 21:07:14	I love Dr Emily and the content she gives on all things relationships and sex, however, a lot of the time I think I’m listening to the same podcast over and over again because there are so many ads, is there an ad free paid version because I find myself bored with all of the ads inserted and giving up on listening. Thanks	3	remiztical	Love the content, however
2023-09-13 20:29:49	"Hi Emily! 

As an occupational therapist, we are specialists in women’s Health. Sexual intimacy, self care, consent, awareness prenatal and post natal are within our scope. Pelvic floor health isn’t just physical therapists and was actually ours and Pts took it on. 

Please expose OT within your podcast to give listeners like myself education.

We can do and cover so much and help so many places and awareness

Love the show"	5	sflot	Occupational therapist
2023-10-14 16:29:49	The fact that she refers to men as “penis owners” and discusses children’s sexuality, made this podcast a hard no for me. Where is the podcast for adults who understand simple science?	1	ashkh4	Hard no
2023-10-04 05:56:40	Banish her to the shadow realm	1	Texas from Texas	She a pedo
2023-08-24 22:05:22	She covers way more than couples when it comes to sex, but from the perspective of a married woman coming for advice about how to keep the marriage alive, I so appreciate all of the tips and tricks and straight up knowledge that she drops on us! All while keeping it fun! I’m here for it. Would recommend.	5	linzcooper	Great podcasts for couples!
2023-08-25 00:26:26	I don’t know what degree of an this person has but she basically kisses the rear end of every guest whether they are right or wrong.	1	Buffaloguy	Not worth the time
2023-08-01 21:37:24	I love this podcast, I have learned so many valuable lessons!!! My sex life is very good and the podcast helps me me with ideas and knowledge!!!	5	dd12$$	Awesome
2023-07-29 15:01:55	"I think Dr. Emily has such a cute voice.
She gets really excited to talk to people when she interviews them. That is because she is so passionate about her work.
Dr. Emily has taught me many things over the years. Each episode seems to go by so fast.
I like how open she is about her own life also.
I really enjoyed her show when it was on Sirius Radio. I was sad when that ended.
However, we still have her Podcast!
I am looking forward to reading Dr. Emily’s  new book! I am going to order it soon.
Please keep up the good work!
I really enjoy the call ins, and advice.
Thanks, Todd"	5	Todd the Electrician.	Been a fan of Emilys for 10 years!
2023-07-27 04:16:04	Yes	5	Aggy Marie	Yes
2023-07-19 15:37:44	I appreciate the fact that you’ve continuously shown up for 15 years and educated your listeners about sex. I’ve learned much about sex education from you and much about my body too (and I’m still learning). I hope you don’t stop soon	5	Kate-Flora	Thank you Dr Emily
2023-07-17 15:45:47	+1 (509) 934-5978 my number if anyone wants to talk and sexy stuff. Btw I’m a 15 year old female looking for a lover don’t care if it’s a female or a male	5	okigiveupat nicknames	Text me or sext me
2023-06-19 02:54:31	I love so much about this show. I love how matter of fact Dr. Emily is about absolutely everything having to do with sex and relationships, her focus on authenticity and communication and feeling safe, and her willingness to share freely and openly about her own experiences and feelings and insecurities. This should be required listening for everyone, regardless of what they think they already know about sex and their own desires.	5	jaligal	The Sex Ed we all wish we’d had as a teen (or young adult, or whenever)
2023-07-09 15:56:00	"I tried to listen to this podcast. 
1. Emily has the most annoying voice ever. 
2. Emily interrupts everyone and talks over everyone. Just stop and actively listen and let people finish what they are saying! 
3. The podcast is poorly conducted. Episodes where callers can’t hear them and they go back and forth saying “can you hear me” or “call us back”. 
I’m done. If you’re an expert Emily and you want to help people….give people the chance to talk too."	1	Leedster23	I tried.
2023-06-29 22:07:20	I understand talking about discovering one’s body at a young age, but the portion of ‘Sexy Stories: Pegging & Partnered Orgasms’ where so goes into graphic detail about literal children (again, 8 & 9 years old) masturbating came off as pedophillic. I’m going to be finding a different sex podcast now.	1	0593walker	Grossed out by her segment highlighting stories of 8 & 9 year olds masturbating
2023-06-11 18:40:18	Hubby & I listened to your interview with Dru P & it was so informative, encouraging & and 👀 eye opening! I’m a full on subscriber now! Thanks for sharing your expertise.	5	Wings4Women	First time - Virgin Listener
2023-06-11 03:51:13	It would hand been helpful for the host to listen to the expert.	1	DDPirate	Just annoying

I’ve been a long time listener; and even had my boyfriend pre-order your book!

2023-04-15 16:30:55	Listening to the Sex with Emily podcast has been life changing. I was in a relationship for 7 years with very vanilla sex. Recently divorced and ready to enjoy my next chapter, a friend sent me this podcast. I listened to few episodes and was immediately hooked. I wanted more for myself and my sexual pleasure but I never learned how to figure out what I like, how to ask for it and how to enjoy pleasing my male partners. This podcast has opened my eyes to a whole new world. I am so much more comfortable with myself and my sexual experiences. Previously I thought talking about sex or asking for what you want was taboo. Boy was I wrong. I have learned so much and I love this sexual wellness journey. Thanks Emily for keeping it real, helping others and sharing the best tips and products to improve our sex lives!	5	RachSuzS	Life Changing Podcast! I’m hooked!
2023-04-22 04:13:18	The entire episode was a plug for her book.	1	not umoressed	Not impressed
2023-04-14 16:43:05	It is good  . I think my friends should see it	5	gk riyad	Inspiring
2023-04-15 12:00:29	But I find Dr. Emily to be extremely annoying. I feel like she talks over people when they are asking questions.	2	Rlgamble07	Interesting Topics
2023-03-29 15:32:15	Thank you for opening my mind to new ideas about sex!	5	Jeni.8675309	Thank you!
2023-04-12 13:46:38	I couldn’t get over the ads for filler and appearance altering things. For a podcast that is sex and body positive, these ads had the opposite effect and I stopped listening	3	Hmcfrdnc	Bad advertisements
2023-03-16 19:33:24	"I have been a fan and low key listener for years now. So grateful for all your information and for being so fun cool playful. Your confidence is radiant and you are such an inspiring powerful feminine. Lots of love!

2023-01-27 02:08:47	All of this and the above!!	5	megaroni83	Communication is Lubrication
2023-03-10 22:37:32	My wife and I listened a lot and we really like this podcast but the host who is in control of the streaming is absolutely horrible. We finally just gave up because all it does is stutter. We can go to other podcasts and listen may be in our car may be at home with our Wi-Fi, but for some reason this podcast just skips constantly it’s totally frustrating. We have found ourselves listening to other podcasts that don’t do this and when we mentioned it to another married couple friend of ours, they said the same thing they finally gave up trying to listen to it as well.	1	dogedadog	Stuttering
2023-02-13 20:13:30	In general was very excited to listen but the only 2 random episodes I clicked on I had to fast forward about 5 minutes bc they were adds or her talking about selling promoting something.	2	AguilarS79	Blah blah
2023-01-20 04:31:19	🍆😫😩🤤🥴	5	nfjdfbhf	I love masterbating
2023-01-15 13:02:40	I have learned so much and my relationship with my husband is even better for it! I recommend this podcast to everyone I know!!	5	Flier777rg	What a great reference!
2022-12-25 21:59:42	Excellent information on all sex topics. We are curious and need to hear that sex is an expression of love and pleasure and adventures. We all need to feel safe as we explore our own sexuality.	5	Life Is Wonderful Love	We Love Sex
2022-12-03 00:12:17	Love the openness and communication on a formerly taboo topic!	5	Samy-Wants-apple-health	Excellent insights
2022-12-18 04:49:05	Men basically are okay to be used and thrown away in the host’s opinion. Also, very abusive and harmful behaviors are encouraged merely because one party gets a few seconds of pleasure.	1	D-Evans	Toxic towards men
2022-12-12 17:18:09	Absolutely love the content of the show and Emily as a presenter but the Kidz Bop ads are driving me insane and my wife and I have stopped listening.	3	24466970	Kids bop needs to go!
2022-12-07 13:48:37	Can’t understand the host. Talks way too fast. I thought this was supposed to be an informative sex podcast for adults, but it’s actually really bad advice from a grown, “educated” woman constantly saying “p*nis owners & v*lva owners”.	1	Sas56978975	Ewww
2022-10-29 20:30:18	"Just about every show gives singles and couples helpful information on how to help maintain a healthy sexual relationship with your partner/partners. And for those individuals who are less experienced..... This is the place to learn about yourself and what others like! Now the negatives....There is way too many promotional segments! It seems that there are more promotional segments, than actual discussions. Just have your thumb on the ""fast forward"" button! Too much promotional content!"	3	U.S. reader	Definitely informative!
2022-10-27 05:29:44	Haven’t heard it yet. Just recommended.	2	Stephennnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!	Do you take Calls?
2022-05-29 07:19:31	Makes talking about sex really approachable and has great insight and advice - I particularly liked the boundaries episode. However, when she brings on guests or callers she has a tendency to cut them off or not let them finish their thought before moving onto the next topic or ending the conversation altogether.	4	great show but cuts people orf	Great show but cuts people off
2022-10-25 15:48:58	My favorite part of this podcast is how inclusive Emily is. Wether it be bodily functions or someone’s unique kink she makes sure people understands this is all normal.  She has taught me so much and I think it’s so important to be open minded going into this pod and ready to learn something new .	5	ToHaveAndToWallace	Obsessed
2022-10-18 23:52:42	Thank you Emily !	5	amylohr1111	Helpful :)
2022-10-06 15:41:09	These “doctors” need more education. Encouraging abusive ideas isn’t safe or normal at all but has been normalized by harmful things such as pornography and the media (they are enmeshed) which by the way you should learn the effects of as well. I’ll give you a hint, it’s not good at all. From dramatic frontal lobe shrinkage to a completely fried brain reward system to perpetuating misogyny and harming others, to name a few. Fight The New Drug podcast is way better…	2	ashleynaomi.co	Some people just shouldn’t give advice
2022-09-29 18:51:53	thank you emily for making me feel a little less alone on all topics related to sex	5	saradoane	destigmatizing so many subjects that i felt too awkward to talk about!
2022-09-23 02:41:25	Love Dr Emily! She’s just so down to earth and gives great advice - not just about sex but about communication and relationships in general.	5	Lins1117	Fun and informative

2022-08-23 11:43:38	I’ve (cis-male, 50) been listening to Emily for several years now. While the episodes more directly related to sex acts have been incredibly helpful, I’ve found the more nuanced shows about communication (love languages, boundaries, etc ) instrumental in helping myself and my wife evolve as partners and has has both excited for what’s to come next in our (sex) lives. Thanks Emily!	5	GG <	This show changed my life!
2022-08-12 18:24:49	I agree with the last reviewer this show is toxic towards men.	1	Uzi63	Toxic
2022-08-06 18:28:11	Sorry but after listening for a year and wondering if this woman is being purposely toxic towards men or not, the Gabrielle Blair episode sealed the deal for me. Listen to the first 10 mins and prove me wrong. Disgusting.	1	dave slaugs	Toxic to Men
2022-07-19 02:38:28	Loved the Jenny episode. So real and funny	5	elsbuckeye	Jenny Mollen episode
2022-07-17 20:49:49	I want to like this podcast but I have such a hard time understanding what she’s actually saying. She does that Dr. Oz thing where she rushes through phrases with no enunciation. It’s just a blur of gibberish. I had to rewind 10 times to understand the name of a company & product she was mentioning. It’s so frustrating. I don’t know if I can continue to listen even though the topics sound interesting. Please get some voice coaching!	2	Anonie65	Talks too Fast
2022-06-30 17:59:20	Stated learning late in life (44) and feel like I’ve learned so much about how to just let it all go and ask for what i need. Not getting any younger and it’s time to start letting go and enjoying myself Sexually.	5	HornyinJerZ	Love Emily!
2022-06-17 02:39:35	So think this is great pod but I have a question because I am going to start to do sex with my girlfriend so does it hurt the penis? Thanks	5	tmytdmytdmyfc	Question
2022-05-05 14:47:05	Great show but please stop interrupting your guests so much. It’s hard to listen to it all the time.	4	KW990	Good but interrupts a lot

2022-05-06 23:07:02	I cannot believe how unprofessional she is by the mass amounts of interruptions she does while her guests are talking. She will also interrupt multiple times in an attempt to get them off the phone and to the next caller. One episode in and it happened so many times I’m not sure how she hasn’t improved this awful bad habit.	1	emily: shush and listen	Constantly interrupting!
2022-04-30 23:32:15	Emily is a fantastic host and making it easier for people to communicate around this topic. Very much appreciate this podcast!	5	Dino500	Love
2022-04-30 21:17:34	I started listening to Sex With Emily a couple of years ago and I’m SO glad I did! I grew up with little to no dialogue around sex and my sex education in school was honestly laughable. This podcast has encouraged me to think about sex differently, which includes actually talking about it, which is so refreshing and liberating. As a woman I feel very empowered by listening and learning to this podcast; it has inspired a sexual awakening for my husband and I and I’m so grateful. Highly recommend giving it a listen. Thank you Emily for liberating the conversations around sex 😊 Keep up the good work, you are making a difference!	5	Mrah0517	Super informative sex positive podcast for all listeners
2022-03-02 03:01:01	Are there any ladies here 😏😏😏	4	torh torh torh 567	Bruh
2022-04-24 09:29:27	I wish I could tell the other reviewers here to look around at other podcasts. Sure, this one ranks highly, but give sex pods like Your Mileage May Vary a try, even just as a counterpoint. Different views are fun and enlightening!	3	DVesu	Good but not great
2022-04-13 17:35:49	Thank you… my blow job is 💯	5	grrrmylife	Yes… ooh… yes
2022-04-09 15:19:42	I’ve listened to this show on and off for years.  I started listening  again until I heard the penis owning term used.  In  attempt to be inclusive the host has embarrassed herself.	2	Presidentjay	Words have meaning
2022-04-05 18:05:30	I just started listening to this podcast a few weeks ago. It has really helped me start taking action on some struggles I have with anxiety, sexual fantasies, how to talk about sex with your partner, ask for the things you want, etc. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Even if you have a great sex life. Dr. Emily does a fantastic job of kindly addressing everyone’s questions in a non-judgemental way. She has excellent guest speakers including therapists, comedians, doctors, and mental health experts.	5	Justin_1117	Just Started Listening - Wow!
2022-03-22 22:29:10	Guys do yourself a favor and listen to a few episodes a week. It really helps.	5	GoingDuckWild	Love the show
2022-03-11 22:29:50	I’ve been listing since the pandemic began. I had struggled with confidence to speak up about the things I like in the bedroom(or anywhere else in the home) I wasn’t taught much about it other than that’s where babies come from and you don’t want that until you’re married but hearing ppl around me having sex. I wanted to try but I felt so much shame if I did it and I was shamed for wanting that magical BIG O. I didn’t get one until I explored myself and same sex partners. I thank Emily and her guest for their advice, knowledge and experiences. I wouldn’t have never imagined myself having this much fun from what I thought was a shameful thing to do. Next step getting a we vibe one day. ❤️❤️❤️❤️	5	Enjoli123	Please tune into this podcast
2022-01-30 22:32:12	I love this podcast because Emily is such an pro and really answers so many questions that I think too many people don’t talk about. Emily also talks about subjects with compassion and kindness and it’s just so refreshing. Very grateful I found this podcast!	5	ashleydinkel1	So informing and transparent
2022-02-10 15:54:18	Lovely information that Emily is sharing on the podcast but the amount of times that she interrupts her  guests with one liners is obnoxious !!! please let your guess finish their sentences you’re not adding anything important With these one-liners  …the episode with Wednesday Martin was just crazy the  amount of times she had to add something.	3	_caroleena_	Good information but…..
2022-02-07 14:28:02	"Can Emily get some better recording equipment? The sound quality is really poor some episodes, but not all of them. 
Also, please stop eating on air. It’s distracting to us and you."	3	Wasssuppp183737382	Good information

2022-01-13 16:47:55	I appreciate how the show’s content and subject matter have evolved throughout the years to become more inclusive and holistic. Emily’s interview style is more grounded than ever, and this year's guests were exceptional.  Emily, thank you for sharing your learning journey and path to self-discovery with your listeners. The 2021 recap does a great job of highlighting this growth and progression.	5	Allie 🐊	So much growth and transformation
2022-01-18 06:30:18	I am DISGUSTED. Jamie Lynn Spears was given a platform on this podcast. It’s not without notice that Lou Taylor follows the host of the show on social media. Will not listen again to this podcast. Abusers should not be given a platform to lie and gaslight. The host shouldn’t be called Daddy- horrific money chaser with no morals is a more appropriate term. Steer clear.	1	Rowwbot	Provided a platform for an abuser
2021-12-23 18:16:17	I can’t even begin to describe all the ways this podcast has helped me, educated me, and elevated my sex life in ways I never thought possible.  Emily has a way about her that makes you feel like you’re listening to an old friend chat about sex and relationships. Plus, she’s so open and non-judgemental that it made me start to question the programming and toxic messaging that I received about sex growing up.  I  started to release all of that shame and the beliefs that no longer served me. This podcast has been very eye-opening and has shaped the way I have talked to my daughters about sex and how I will continue to talk to them about it into the future.  Thank you, Emily! You have no idea how life changing you’ve been to me!	5	Ginabrit	What a revelation
2021-11-23 18:49:11	This is one of my favorite podcasts! I’ve been listening for quite some time and I love Emily’s casual, yet informative approach!	5	Sinnyhendrix	Love this podcast
2021-11-17 20:42:20	Love the Podcast! My wife and I have found Dr Emily very informative, entertaining, and helpful! Love all the communication tips too!	5	LeeWaters3	Awesome!
2021-11-10 19:16:05	I really love how Emily is educating and normalizing sex talks! Im in my 20s and i keep sending episodes to my friends so they can feel liberated and confident in their feelings and desires in the bedroom. I started using lube thanks to Emily and i even changed my fiancé’s mindset about lube. Now we always use it and we get excited about trying new ones! Thanks Emily, and keep changing the stigma on sex!	5	TeeJax1	Can’t stop sharing this podcast!
2021-10-31 00:32:38	Sex with Emily? Oh, I wish… seriously, this lady is not afraid of anything. She takes on some really important questions for all of us (male or female or however you identify) who are wanting more from our sex life. Even better, she is so supportive of her listeners and celebrates where they are already are in their sexual exploration. Thank you, Emily! Your podcast is a treasure!	5	oldermcali	Best Sex Podcast Ever!!!
2021-08-21 15:50:34	I enjoy listening to the soft voice and educational care taken with such a delicate topic. There are many sessions that I listen to with the hope of enjoying time with my wife. Most sessions are at the very lease thought provoking and enjoyable. These topics discussed are beneficial and enjoyable for us as a couple. Thank you for providing such helpful information with an entertaining quality. The wife even took a look at some stuff too. Eventually we will be able to try some more stuff out. I’ll keep you posted. Thank you	4	Joestak	All most
2021-10-12 23:24:17	Very diverse and helpful topics. She’s super enthusiastic and nonjudgmental!	5	J-eight	Don’t know how this isn’t rated 5 stars everytime
2021-10-10 16:55:20	Sex with Emily is shallow and you won’t get any better advice than you would from Cosmo. Listen to Emily’s episode interviewing Esther Perel. It’s like a child interviewing a wise adult. Emily can’t keep up and has nothing to offer. Listen to Esther Perel’s podcast instead.	1	Monkey2ewok	Listen to Esther Perel instead
2021-10-01 14:17:25	Sex with Emily podcast is a GAME CHANGER & I am so thankful to have come across it! At almost 27 years old (sexually active since 14 years old) I am finally learning about my sexuality and enjoying all things sex!! Growing up I never had anyone to talk about sex with therefore it was always an awkward subject for me to talk about.. even with my poor husband!! Today I am feeling more confident, open and pleasured than ever!! Thank you Dr. Emily for creating a safe space to help so many people feel normal and for educating them so they can reach their fullest pleasure potential!	5	Courtney.marie<3	OBSESSED! GAME CHANGER!
2021-09-29 17:51:54	I barely discovered Emily and her wisdom at 31 and I am glad! She’s provides thoughtful content. I love that she bring in other experts to provide context, and she makes a topic like sex seem so rational to discuss. As it should be.	5	Erm0319	The podcast I’ve needed
2021-09-20 19:33:38	Dr. Emily, host of the Sex With Emily podcast, highlights all aspects of relationships and more in this can’t miss podcast!  The host and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!	5	EricaBushwell	Awesome podcast!
2021-09-09 18:25:41	Love listening to this podcast and I think Emily has a lot of great advice BUT I can’t stand how often she interrupts her guests and rushes them off the line. Please let them speak!	3	sunshine.daydream	Almost great
2021-09-01 14:21:23	I always learn something each episode!	5	BatmanChalup@	Super podcast
2021-08-28 06:58:34	Love!	5	addyyyg	Consistently good:)
2021-08-27 21:14:09	Every episode I listen to makes me think and helps me unwind the societal programming around sex. Please share this with your friends and love partners.	5	MarciBrockmann27	Such a wonderful show!
2021-08-21 21:01:40	Love the podcast. Everyone will find something interesting, educational or simply entertaining! Recommending to all of my friends.	5	Podcast2020Listener	Amazing!
2021-08-21 17:52:04	"Enjoy listening to the variety of topics & guests.

Emily is great!"	5	pereeli	Purely Honest
2021-07-19 14:37:07	I love Emily’s energy and how educational she is. No questions are off limits and you can tell she never judges her writers/callers at all!	4	Fabulous!!!!!!!!!	So educational!
2021-08-16 21:22:05	Really wanted to like this podcast after 2 friends recommended it, but I find the topics of conversation pretty boring and don’t feel like Emily’s advice is anything different from what you can read in a silly cosmo article. Someone will call in with a nuanced/complex situation and she’ll just say “have you tried communicating with your partner?!” I also don’t feel she deeply connects with her guests who call in and always seems eager to end the call and move on to the next, it feels awkward.	2	Liv2983638	No depth
2021-07-28 01:05:43	Episode “Up Your Love Language” is so good.. I’m only half way through right now but it’s worth it. I also love all her others too.	5	MaddieMorgan4	Love love love and recommend
2021-07-07 22:43:31	I LOVE this show! Emily has opened my eyes to so many different aspects of sexuality. Love when she answers calls no matter what they’re asking about.	5	Lindenfield	A Whole New Sex Life
2021-07-17 15:08:22	Emily seems nice but Menace comes off like a jerky 20-something. He has ridiculously misogynistic views and really wants everyone to hear them. I thought Emily might wisen him up at some point but no, she agrees with his views most of the time.	2	tomiscuddlebear	Plays like stereotypical morning radio
2021-06-10 03:15:06	Loved this episode. So enlightening and really explains a lot to me about my relationships over the years. Thanks Emily for bringing so much value to your listeners. Love your show.	5	Curious Sexual Explorer	Emily and Dr Helen Fisher are amazing!
2021-06-02 14:43:54	Thanks for all you do!	5	Rose S. H.	Love you, Emily!
2021-06-07 00:28:16	Not the podcast though. Follow my social medias guys. My Instagram and tiktok is sonnywalters2001 and my Twitter is sonnywalters_	1	scwjesuswept	I like the picture😍❤️
2021-05-25 03:49:44	But yikes, some of her guests are just…trash. This latest piece of work, Light whoever, was just such an essentialist creep. Who still speaks about the binary in such explicit, regressive terms outside of Fox or NewsMax? Ew!	4	carla2692	Dr. Emily is a QUEEN
2021-06-02 12:24:38	The Allen phisher episode had SO MUCH POTENTIAL!!! But Emily kept speaking over her and it was so annoying.. i was really trying to listen to what Allen phisher had to say but emily just kept chiming in with things that are so irrelevant	1	nvicky141415	Love Emily but she talks to fast and interrupts
2021-05-20 14:06:39	I’m in my 40s. I don’t have sisters or close girl friends to talk about this stuff with, so this has been a game-changer. Lots of sound information and recommendations. I love that this show holds no secrets, is based on women’s perspectives, and opens the door for women to discuss sex without the taboo or shame.	5	KendraHT	Absolutely worth the 5 stars!
2021-05-20 12:45:03	"Thanks so much for this podcast, I have learned so much even as a woman over 50. I have been married over 20 years. 
Thanks, 
Amelie"	5	Macroluv Photograper	Awesome Podcast
2021-05-05 12:42:59	Great podcast. As a male, your podcasts are teaching me so much about sex, woman, what ways women want to be pleasured. Thanks Dr. Emily	5	sussex Mike	Lady Gang Podcast
2021-04-18 21:15:01	I love this show! Thank you Emily for providing me this super helpful resource.! There are episodes that support me, a 49-yo divorced woman, that support my clients (women in their midlife), and that support my sons (ages 18-25). So great! Thanks	5	3 buoys	Outstanding resource for all ages
2021-04-28 06:44:57	"I’m not talking about the commercials. Her guest are advertising their services. So I feel like there is a hidden agenda to their advice. Example: how not to die alone. You’re a lazy dater go on 100 on dates. You get these dates through online dating. Oh by the way I work at hinge which is meant for you to delete. You should try it. 

Signs up.  What do I get? Sold same old online dating. I’d rather die alone."	2	Mexicangirlwholoveskdramas	Too much advertising
2021-04-27 05:44:47	I really love listening to this podcast! Very informative, interesting and exciting!! I do however wish that Emily would not talk over everyone. Also, it seems that she spends time with some callers and really rushes with others, like they can barely get out their full question without her saying .. “ok thank you!” Those are my only complaints. If you can bypass that, then everyone should listen to this podcast. I have learned so much!	3	hannahdavis1153	Love this podcast! But..
2021-04-21 15:12:49	I thought the content was good. I heard Emily on another podcast and loved it so I followed to listen but it is nearly impossible to follow because she interrupts the guests and then they just end up talking over each other. I thought maybe it was the one episode I listened to but after multiple episodes it’s just her style. Doesn’t make for a good listening experience.	1	Heatherannh	Hard to listen to
2021-04-08 22:43:19	Yah	5	scfs tv jhdsj	G
2021-04-14 13:18:32	Interesting content and questions, but she tends to interrupt a few of the guests quite a bit	3	95fran	Good, but interrupts
2021-03-30 23:14:44	Emily and her staff are SO knowledgable and helpful. I have learned so much from this podcast and look forward to Tuesday and Friday every week to listen to the new episodes. Keep up the amazing work!!	5	Oviecrum	LOVE THIS SHOW!
2021-03-17 14:52:47	I think everyone can benefit from listening to this show. Beyond sex, the core of the show is about exploring and getting to know yourself.	5	jayclaymann	Must listen
2021-03-23 18:39:53	Extremely one sided and ableist views on birth control??	1	Jaineisabatcat	birth control
2021-02-26 04:58:10	Hey I’m a new Mamabear 22 years old, found your podcast about a month ago and it has made a big change in my relationship already! Made me feel more comfortable to talk about our sex life.help me make things hotter after having our first baby! Thank you i always been shy and embarrassed now I can talk to my partner about making our sex life better and pleasuring each other more/better.	5	pizzacatCo	Getting better and more open in sex life
2021-03-02 13:26:18	I was recommended this pod by a friend, and was excited to check out the episode on boundaries. Less than halfway through the episode the guest & host had each mentioned people with personality disorders in a stigmatizing way. Do better. Automatically grouping people with personality disorders as “toxic” or unable to understand boundaries is hurtful and adds to the shame and stigma we experience.	2	destigmatize bpd	Stop Stigmatizing Personality Disorders
2021-02-22 23:14:08	Great podcast! As a woman in my 50’s I thought I knew a lot about sex, I’m learning so much more listening to this podcast! Things I’ve never even thought about.  Emily’s voice is smooth, not irritating.  It’s almost like hanging out with a friend!	5	98goldengate	Wow!
2021-02-11 21:25:23	Emily and her guests make me feel completely at home here - bowled over by brilliant advice and nourishing conversations. Grateful for this amazing resource!	5	Arlie K	Authentic + Empowering
2021-02-17 18:26:17	I had heard great things about this podcast but was so disappointed at how much it made me cringe. Not terribly helpful advice and she CONSTANTLY talks over her guests and interrupts them.	1	effersonjefferson	Not what I expected
2021-02-11 18:01:33	Dr. Emily Morse is sweet, but her show is quite vapid. If you’re interested in topics of sexuality, there are many more interesting podcasts than this one. Sorry. I really wanted to like it, but just couldn’t find any episodes worth listening to.	1	DvGuts	MEH...
2020-12-15 23:14:18	Awesome show, found you from Call her Daddy. The only thing is that in the latest episode there is a loud noise in the background the entire time that made me not able to finish the episode. It sounds like someone is scratching their head non stop :(	4	Young Cress	Great show
2021-02-10 02:58:18	I’m only 11 mins in and am cringing with every interruption you spew out while your guest is speaking. I know you might be excited and might not want to forget what you want to talk about, but Christ, let them speak. So rude and ruins it, especially when I tune in for the guest you have on. I will never listen again.	1	Lolitas_mama	Stop rudely cutting off your guest as they speak
2021-02-05 05:03:11	So glad I found this podcast. Great advice and tips ♥️	5	Missanabel	Great👌🏼
2021-01-22 13:26:40	I could go on and on about how Emily’s tips have completely transformed my sex life but I think any listener could say the same. What really stands out about Emily’s podcast is her dedication to inclusivity and her infectious energy. She is 10/10 my absolute favorite and I highly recommend to ALL people!	5	nacho'smom	Emily is Everything!
2021-01-18 13:09:52	05 Jan 2021 episode This is So very helpful.	5	Musicman Dan	Great

2020-12-22 23:04:05	Been listening to Sex with Emily for a couple months now and have tried new things I thought I never would. It’s also made me much more confident with myself and my partner and how to articulate intimate talks. I’m learning all the tips and tricks and excited to keep improving in the bedroom!!! Also purchased flavored lube I have yet to try on my partner 🤪	5	Kyco1919	Life altering!
2020-12-17 20:19:38	the Chicago are,  Love your show. Your tips& tricks work well	5	morningside+1	Great broadly.  What time and days are you live in
2020-12-17 07:49:10	As a longtime listers I appreciate the perspective and openness from your podcasts. You look great !	5	Aaron95747	Love the rebranding
2020-12-13 22:22:35	so i heard about Emily from Call Her Daddy and i fell in love with her . idk how to put this but for the longest i have been looking for assistance dealing with intimacy but i was way too ... scared to ask anyone . my friend referred me to podcasts bc there may be people who understand and have been thru it too that i could hear out . listening to that podcast brought me a mixture of laughter , shock , amazement , and TIPS . I tried a few things mentioned and wow i love this . I also love how they don’t just talk about “doing the do” , but also the straight up deep thoughts everyone has and the empowerment of doing what you feel is right , and pleasing yourself before anyone. omg i love this , and i’m listening to every episode as we speak. i wish i knew about her and Alex earlier. ❤️game changers ❤️	5	ten-mic	GAME CHANGERS✨
2020-12-15 23:06:33	Just nonsense talk	1	JEKDC	No real info
2020-12-12 02:24:35	Smart. To the point. And she delivers information in a legible and approachable way. Thank you, Emily.	5	EyeVt	She’s brilliant.
2020-12-05 15:33:26	Emily is very informative and has advice from pleasure, health and relationships!! She has several guests that are specialized in specific industries and other healthcare officials.	5	the walking dictionary	Very Informative
2020-12-12 00:27:04	She has a bachelor’s degree... she doesn’t have a doctorate degree	1	it'smeandmyselfandi	Fraud not a real Dr
2020-12-11 18:40:07	Cannot support someone who brings on Alex Cooper as a guest. She gives the worst advice and it often very misogynistic.	1	callieann3966	Nope
2020-12-08 04:39:27	"Wut😳😳😳
I do not get the point of this podcast.🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮"	1	prson who txts in slang	Uhm...wut
2020-12-05 22:56:33	I guess this show isn’t what I was looking for. When you bring in a specialist who is a Psychological Astrologist, I’m going to have to bow out. Horoscopes may be a fun gimmick, but they don’t have a place when you’re giving people serious advice.	2	CancerousOrdo	“Psychological Astrologist”? Okay then...
2020-12-02 19:19:25	Great	5	IOnlyReviewBadMusic	Great
2020-12-01 04:23:42	"Having read numerous reviews, I think I’ll unsubscribe without listening to any episodes. A lot of times podcasts can get a wide range of reviews. “Dr.” Morse seems to have difficulty letting her guests talk without being interrupted. 

I’m not even going to waste my time."	1	OK Anon	WOW .... INTERESTING REVIEWS
2020-09-10 23:41:16	These are great episodes chock full of information and advice. Well worth listening to. I have just one small complaint. Emily sometimes talks over her guests trying to make a point instead of waiting for her guest to finish and then making her point.	4	MustBJones	A font of information.
2020-11-29 13:51:28	Started listening and was disappointed with the level of depth in discussion. Very opinion based. Give the host a Google and see where she got her higher Ed “degree.” She’s just a radio personality.	1	raeganN27	Disappointing
2020-11-21 07:05:36	"I had no idea that I needed to hear someone say “Pleasure is your birth right”. This phrase did so much for me, likely tempering an upbringing of guilt and shame around sex.
Also, using my breath as an anchor during sex has made my anxiety manageable instead of paralyzing.  Thank you for helping me to move past the pain.  I have struggled with this for fifteen years."	5	please talk better	Your Masterclass changed my life
2020-11-19 18:42:39	"Hi Emily,
Hope all is well with you!
Listen I absolutely love your Podcast as your tips are absolutely the best .
Thanks have a fantastic day!!"	5	lovesfood7272	Hey Emily
2020-11-15 23:20:29	I just recently heard about this podcast because of an instagram post and was looking forward to listening to the “biohack” episodes. I was pretty disappointed. First, the host talks in strict terms of “male and female” and “men and women” and clearly does not understand the spectrum of gender. Not queer friendly. Second, she makes very broad sweeping claims about both men and women that does not acknowledge ANY nuance in human experience. She talks about women as all having the exact same body and experiences and men as all having the exact same body and experiences. This is a poorly informed podcast.	2	dax-attack	Very cisheteronormative and generalistic
2020-11-06 21:30:01	Awesome episode. John is not only fun to listen to but gives great advice. Please have him on more	5	Hazelman2	Latest episode with John Hill
2020-10-19 20:16:36	Amazing show and you learn a lot from this!! Keep it up Emily this is awesome !!!	5	Bryce.s.davis	Great show
2020-10-03 18:15:11	This podcast is simply ads and interruptions. If you want a good sex and relationship podcast go listen to dan savage. He still has some ads but the advice is waaay better and more interesting.	1	hector_victorious	Dan Savage is better
2020-10-03 17:36:55	I would love this podcast if Menace had nothing to do with it. I can’t stand the overly neurotic and misogynist attitude. Love Emily though.	2	waterbegood	Menace, no.
2020-09-28 11:48:19	I listened to the whole 1st episode and of the whole hour they had the only spend 10 minutes actually talking about the title topic. The rest was just random talking which isn’t what I wanted from this podcast. I was fairly disappointed by this.	2	kfndosm	Disappointed
2020-09-17 16:40:30	This show makes me feel less crazy for being one of those girls that has always been a little too sexual for most people.. I love that she can talk openly about things that would make most people embarrassed.. The guests she has are always interesting too	5	LadyDaka	This show...
2020-08-29 22:32:38	Every week I listen to this show and Sex Therapy with Dr. Jones.	4	Gracie2.5	One of my favs
2020-09-08 04:54:15	Have been listening for years! Love Emily and Jamie! I think she’s an incredible interviewer. She talks as much as I do and I love it! No judgement just love xoxoxo	5	gabrielle taconet	😍
2020-09-02 01:14:01	Used to like this show but after signing with satalite radio it is obvious that the podcast is an afterthought.  Disappointed, but I guess thats how it goes.  Sometimes it seems like a call in show, other times a long commercial.  In short, not what it used to be, not in a good way.	2	Icecoldken	pod became an afterthought
2020-08-27 19:24:30	I don’t have many female friends so for me talking about sex and relationships are hard, listening to Emily makes me feel like I have a great girlfriend to give me advise on so many aspects of life not just sex!	5	09marshmellow	Love Love Love Emily
2020-08-29 15:04:49	"Love the show Emily! Love the funny raw information around normalizing sex talk. 

I want to love every show but I find myself staying away from your shows with guest speakers because they end up getting cut off in the middle of a great point that I want to hear more about. I’d love it if you’d let your guests have the floor, and work to not pull the table cloth from under them. They’re being featured so we can get THEIR insights. Let em have their moment girl!"	2	abigailsondrol	Pink peaches
2020-08-07 04:35:37	Emily is so open and makes all topics so easy to take in. There is laughter and learning in every episode. Her credentials and expertise say “White Lab Coat” but her demeanor is warm and so likable. Here guests and callers talk to her as if they were talking to their best friend. She’s got the right formula for making us all feel sex as the liberating and empowering human experience it is!	5	3rdL	My kind of Dr ...
2020-08-08 13:02:47	Lame nonsense.	1	MikeMach44	Boring.
2020-07-31 22:14:07	puts a super fun spin on talking about sex!	5	Sunrise97654	love this podcast
2020-08-06 17:32:20	Was excited to give this a go, but immediately you can see the talking over other people like others note and it didn’t seem like it was going to cease or let up anytime soon. Then the constant accusations pinned on this guy menace (whom I know nothing about) was overwhelming. The failure to want to acknowledge anything he said that went against her opinion made me not want to go any further.	2	isles102217	Couldn’t get through the first 5 minutes
2020-06-26 11:22:39	I like this podcast and her guests are awesome but Emily interrupts her guests wayyyy too much...a great interviewer knows how to interview and let the interviewees speak and finish thoughts and I don’t like that Emily doesn’t do that. Other than that I like the podcast.	4	rnamery	Good but too much interruption
2020-07-21 04:10:43	To be honest, I love it sometimes and hate it others. I had a three hour car ride yesterday and listened to two episodes but the recent episode with Dr. Drew P was truthfully unbearable to listen to. Two people who wouldn’t listen and just wanted to talk, so much interrupting and talking over each other I couldn’t understand what either was saying and just turned it off. I see a lot of feedback about this and think small changes could make a big difference.	3	morrisae	50/50
2020-07-17 11:54:21	I love listening to the interviewees and the listeners who call in with questions but Emily simply talks too much. She can take a topic which could be discussed in 30 seconds and talk about it for ten minutes. And lastly she needs to stop interrupting those she interviews - she brings them on as experts in their fields and then answers her own questions.	2	BILLY19543	Too much talk
2020-07-17 01:57:52	I really like her content and she has some great guests, but Emily interrupts her guests/callers entirely too much. It becomes extremely distracting and is disrespectful to the guests and callers. If she could let them finish their thoughts without jumping in it would be much easier to listen to. Emily please take a breath and let them speak!	3	blueeyedbetty20	Sex with Emily
2020-06-27 21:59:20	I absolutely love this show!! I have really learned a lot!!  The guests are great, and I think Emily is a very good person.  She loves to help people.  I am not in a relationship right now, but I have so much knowledge to use in my future relationships. I just ordered the Lioness, and I look forward to using it!  Thank you, Emily and staff!  I love getting to know you through this podcast.	5	Jekyl1980	Jennifer from South Florida

2020-05-18 03:40:09	R u kidding “ More sexy fun!” That’s the stupidest thing I have ever heard!! You should rename that and and I think studying relationships is STUPID!	1	xdvkcgjv	Omg
2020-05-12 22:50:14	I initially listened to garner insight, then I shared it with my spouse.  Now she won’t let me / us stop listening, and we’re both reaping the benefits.	5	Greenie58	Required Listening

2020-04-26 19:15:52	I just started listening to this podcast a few days ago and really like it!  Emily has interviewed Dr. Daniel Amen a couple times and the shows were great!  Looking forward to listening to more episodes soon!	5	lit_dave_	Good podcast
2020-04-13 15:32:06	"Subscribed because I heard her on “Too Tired to be Crazy” and thought she was cool. But yeah, she is. 😊

Also, if you are reading this and you call in to the show, please ask your question and hush. You called to get her advice, not to talk over her the whole time. 😩"	5	samanthajoadair	A breath of fresh air
2020-04-08 07:43:26	"I ❤️ this podcast! I sincerely feel like I’m “talking” with friends! I am a lesbian & even though the huge majority of these podcasts are straight people stuff, it is still entertaining & helpful. I’m so glad to have a place to go & listen to subjects that sometimes people have a difficult time talking about. This podcast just puts it out there!
It’s funny, informative, & if you want to kick your sex life up a few notches - you better listen!"	5	JenniLouB	This podcast makes me moist!! (Just kidding)
2020-04-03 21:54:18	Keep up the great work! A must listen to podcast.	5	Cpopepope	Must listen
2020-04-03 15:20:41	Not only between my wife and I but all the doctors and sex gurus are great for talking to our young ones to have good self image and knowing what sex is about. Also a very entertaining show get me through my work day in the dark times. Love the show Emily keep up the great information and removing the stigma of the talks and teachings!	5	Guy THemi	Good Information for building a great sex life.
2020-03-19 01:40:42	I’ve been listening to Sex With Emily for about a year now and let me just say - this Podcast has changed my life in so many ways. Not only have my partner and I grown together by listening together, but I have grown as an individual as well. My partner and I pause throughout episodes to reflect on topics, allowing us to grow closer in and out of the bedroom. As for myself, I have developed a healthy outlook on sexuality with myself and with others, allowing me to shine with confidence and self-love. So many good topics, stories, pieces of advice, product recommendations... these episodes keep me laughing, keep me curious, keep me wanting to share with friends so they can experience this open-minded view on sexuality!!!! Everyone deserves to have this feeling and to have a positive light shown on their sex life & relationships!!! Thank you Emily and crew :)	5	rachierach.	My Favorite Podcast
2020-03-03 19:10:25	Oh the chemistry between Emily and Jude is off the hook! Love these two! Emily always has the best advice ! Thank you !	5	Disco5655	Chemistry!
2020-02-27 19:49:21	I adore Sex w Emily podcast....she addresses all sorts of sex issues and topics- and what I love about it is that it's not just about the problems, but also about possibilities and explorations. Super inspiring.	5	Aliciamaedavon	THE topic nobody talks about but everyone cares SO MUCH about
2020-02-26 17:28:07	I only wish I had this podcast in my life 20 years ago to know what a real relationship can be and know that everything I’ve always wondered about is what a lot of others also wonder about. I really love how Emily is also from Michigan and has that perspective of those of us in the Midwest that are really just fumbling around relationships in the dark and are afraid to call out for help in the dark until it’s too late.. Thanks Dr. Emily	5	sparky665	Eyes wide open now!
2020-01-20 20:41:47	I have listened to the show for years. I miss that you had longer interviews. Since starting with the radio show it seems like we don’t get very long interviews or guest shows. I feel it gets cut off a lot.	4	Increasing my knowledge	Love the show but...
2020-02-24 02:02:55	"Thank you for your help and wisdom exploring the needs of couples.  After a decade of celibacy I have discovered what pleasures can be found in an intimate partnership.  It is wonderful having a coach for support in this area.  Emily, you provide a vital service to those who want to sharpen their skills in the bedroom. 
I feel that I have a chance for success in the monogamous relationship I am about to enter by listening to your podcast.  I love your delivery."	5	jwilson421	New Relationship
2020-02-23 23:41:15	"I am stunned given the number of sex positive podcasts available that this one has any following. 

Emily is woefully naive and willfully ignorantly about things that someone young with a PhD in issues around sex and sexuality. 

I can highly recommend Dan Savage, Sunny Megatron, Why Are People Into That? Many others. 

Emily is so inexperienced in the world writ large it impacts her ability to glean the most impactful information from her guests. Waste of time. So many better podcast hosts out there. Not to mention her voice is so annoying, her questions sophomoric, and she’s sycophantic. A lot of judgmental comments which is stunning coming from a woman who is a “professor”. Don’t waste your time."	1	ZACB	Shockingly naive and judgmental
2020-02-22 15:26:45	This is very women POV.  Not as good for a male perspective.  Always what guys can do and should do.  Not so much the other way.	3	Cricketsc	1 part is missing.
2020-02-20 08:49:56	I love your amazing podcast. I love you . I love your episode. You are a sweetheart.	5	tommy mu	You are so amazing
2020-02-13 01:14:06	"46 yo guy.   Emily that John Kim talk was so relatable.   I’m recently divorced.   I’ve been looking for a woman to make me “whole” when really what I needed was making myself while on my own.  I’m on my own journey.  Starting a nutrition and personal training side hussle.   Finding fulfillment in other areas.   Changing my energy and more self love.   And I’ve read about laws of attraction.   I will attract someone to me by changing my energy and making myself better.   
John Kim is so right.  Your show is so great.  It’s sex.  But you add so many other relevant topics.  
And you’re from MI.   LIKE MYSELF."	5	Crosbo333	Emily ROCKS
2020-02-10 06:44:39	Emily and this podcast have changed the way that I think about sex and intimacy. She covers every topic you could imagine, but I have learned that the biggest thing about sex is communication, and sex is just one part of a relationship. Emily is empathetic, funny, smart, and kind. I love listening to her podcast. My friends tell me I would make a good sex therapist because I make it easy for them to talk about their sex lives. I honestly owe that to Emily.	5	jules12798	Emily normalizes sex and makes it fun
2020-02-07 00:54:40	Love the show, love the conversations! Advice is ah-mazing. Helps me keep things spicy with my husband! You all are amazing!	5	Mistydawn04	Thank You
2020-02-05 12:58:57	Same questions every show. Recycled material from Sirius program. Boring guests. Emily seems uninformed about most topics and appears to be googling her answers to any question that is medical or doesn’t revolve around lube or sex toys. Jamie adds nothing along with the other interns.	1	happenstance76	Redundant.
2020-02-02 00:42:06	This podcast is why Trump will win again. Sad, very sad.	1	Smooth d tickle	Trump 2020
2020-01-29 01:08:56	Definitely been binge listening to the show. Went looking for a way to revive my libido after my OB said most of the time it’s a mental game. Thank you for being so open, honest, and opening my world to how to rebuild intimacy.	5	RacerJX78	Just what I needed!!
2020-01-28 22:47:34	I’ve been listening to this podcast for about a year and have learned so much. I love the openness and honesty of Emily and Jamie! The guest choices are totally on point and I actually look forward to my commute home from work now! Thank you guys! 💕	5	Gigglezz613	🥰🥰🥰 I LOVE THIS PODCAST 🥰🥰🥰
2020-01-26 21:19:48	Emily, this show is incredible! This show is doing the important work of breaking down the walls we, as individuals and as a society, have built up around sex and pleasure. Love this show, love you and your team, love all your guests, you all ROCK! 💞	5	Gspangler20006321467	Breaking Down Walls
2020-01-09 16:27:44	"Emily hosts a great show with the perfect mix of humor and real world information and solutions. Lindsey is the bomb too, only if I was younger.

2020-01-09 01:03:59	I really love Emily’s voice and advice. Very easy to listen too with great advice!	5	bhadaway	Thanks for bringing our spark back
2020-01-07 16:05:15	Love & thank you Emily. What you’re doing here is truly inspiring, educational and entertaining! I love learning new things literally about more than just sex. Taking in all this information has definitely made my life better and happier. Thank you Gorgeous and happy new year! Hope to meet you one day💕	5	Ahsoka_Tano17	Educational AF
2020-01-04 14:49:54	I discovered Sex with Emily when I was researching podcasts, blogs, and books that would empower women to live their best lives. I interviewed women from all over the world, for a book I released in 2019 titled, #NoApprovalNeeded. We discussed topics that mattered to women (including what some might consider some taboo topics such as sex and infidelity). At the end of each chapter, I created some reflection questions and a list of resources to Discover More. I included the Sex with Emily podcast in the resources section in the chapter on sex. I’m a huge fan! Great content in every episode. Thank you!	5	Kris Macc	#NoApprovalNeeded to live your best life
2020-01-07 00:25:46	I think she has a lot of really good information and tips backed up with science but she also makes it seem like you should be so loose sexually and anything goes but some people are fine keeping it simple and that’s cool too. She also downplays the effects porn can have on an individual and on society and the fact that it can truly be addictive and destructive in people’s lives and relationships. I just can’t get behind someone who is trying to push this idea that pornography is 100% good with no side effects. There’s also real science that backs up the harm in it!	2	Alex jamess	Don’t agree with her philosophy
2019-12-26 00:29:14	Im so glad this resource is out there. Emily is awesome and I love how she makes everthing feel approachable and is so knowledgable about so many situations.	5	AutumnBKov	So informative
2019-12-24 13:44:54	Second time I have tried this podcast, and I just can’t listen to it. Really hard to relate to the people talking. West coast “LA” people talking about sex and relationships when that environment is so different than every day Americans.	1	Charles89G	Hard to relate
2019-11-05 14:47:30	Love listening to you but the constant interrupting your guests makes it hard to continue to listen. Let your guest talk!	4	Meganlanee1	Love
2019-12-15 17:03:58	I have listened for almost a year now and I really enjoy all of the advice, the conversation, the people who are being interviewed and the people calling in. I appreciate the safe space that Emily provides and I appreciate that she makes sex and self pleasure a fun and important topic. This is one of the many podcasts I regularly listen to, where I definitely have grown to love myself more and find myself more beautiful and confident. Thank you Emily & Co.!!	5	Anna Rebecca Hodges	Love it!
2019-12-14 00:46:36	I found this podcast through SiriusXM and I was a little disappointed when my subscription ended and I couldn’t listen everyday anymore. But I’m so glad that it’s on iTunes. There is tons of great advice here and my relationship with my partner has improved significantly since I started listening. And I often have conversations with people where a topic comes up that was covered on the show. My favorite was probably when a Lyft passenger was venting to me about how her boyfriend didn’t please her sexually and I was able to recommend a specific episode to her. People may not be open to getting advice from me, but they’re probably open to listening to a podcast episode from an expert in the field. This show is the greatest!	5	Penglet	This is the podcast I listen to most
2019-12-13 11:42:27	A topic I'm extremely interested in, a guest who is intriguing; but way too much time building up, too much personal background, too much personal story telling; get to the novel info, give us a hook at the beginning, something, anything besides predictable bio info to start. sorry. nice idea, try help from a more contemporary producer.	3	light be	Good concept, dull execution
2019-12-12 14:30:27	I listen to the podcast during my 45 min commute. Love it!  I have learned so many great things and my sex life with my husband is probably the best it has ever been (he listened before me! And we have been together 20 years. I also share this with all my friends!  I tell them to listen or always find myself saying “On Sex with Emily...”  I am also super free with discussing sex with friends. No reason to feel shame, everyone is there but no one will talk about it. Thank you so much!	5	nottheiphone	I share it with all my friends!!!!
2019-12-11 15:39:51	The host is extremely knowledgeable but just like past reviews have stated she talks over people. The other reason I am writing the review is because the co-host laughing when they where answering questions. It was extremely rude and uncalled for. The co-host did apologize for the comment but if you cannot keep your composure you should step out of the room during Q&A.	1	BrandonC1239876	Content
2019-12-05 20:09:49	Love this podcast.  My wife and I always listen in the car together. We are always learning something new.  Emily is very informative, honest, entertaining and hot!	5	Bill and Deb	Husband and wife
2019-12-03 22:07:25	& guest selection... -2 stars for the NON STOP interruptions she throws in on her guests. 😩 Shes been in the game for 10+ years so is obviously is successful. But geeeeeez I’m un-subscribing due it. I’ve really tried to “hang in there” and get used to it for over a month... It’s unbearable. It’s sorta like being at a family get together, trying to listen to your cousin who has something worth saying... only to have your drunk aunt constantly interrupting.	2	shanaville.az	3 stars for the CONTENT...
2019-12-03 02:23:04	She does interrupt a lot and speak over like a lot of people say, but the quality is there and I have learned a lot.	5	wxlf_141	Informative
2019-12-02 06:04:48	OMG ,,,, the amount of talking  over each other completely obscures some very good discussion topics .  I’m over it and moving on to other more coherent podcasters .	2	Holy ghost claw	One at a time
2019-11-28 16:38:03	This podcast is so informative! I love it!	5	Anon.y.mous.	Yessss!
2019-11-27 17:13:25	I don’t even know how I found this podcast to be honest but I’m glad I did! I’m currently single and I feel like if I had learned some things that I got from here sooner, maybe they would have gone a bit differently. But hey, now I have tools for the future! It’s given me a lot of perspective while being pretty hilarious at the same time. So thanks Emily and crew for doing what you do!!	5	Kajdfutbelaos	Love this podcast!!
2019-11-19 21:30:28	This podcast is so helpful to all of those people who need a helping hand to have better sex !!  Emily never judges anyone .. only criticism is Emily gets so excited its hard to listen to guests !!!	5	Brookbb8	Love Emily!!
2019-11-19 16:28:30	I like the information, but there’s only so much Incan take listening to the host. She’s constantly interrupting and over-talking her guests (and at the end of one show the guest even called her out on doing it to him the whole interview!).  Not to mention it sounds like she’s hyped up on about 5 different kinds of amphetimines she talks so fast.	3	DKKFYG	Informative but annoying
2019-11-14 18:07:51	New listener from your appearance on Kristen & Chill. Learning more so the psychology of various topics, the why behind the actions. A constant learner & no better subject then women!!	5	jpquest	Learning a lot
2019-11-13 22:11:47	You have helped me so much over the years. More than relationships, you’ve helped with my mental growth and mindfulness. Thanks to you, I have a better relationship with myself.	5	abbyofsteel	Love
2019-11-11 15:48:25	Always great info and fun to listen to. Great Turn on and great ideas To always keep things fresh	5	Darbase	Love this podcast !
2019-11-09 12:21:21	Beautiful woman, but annoying voice, and trash mouth not aligned with her being a “doctor”	2	Midcenturyman	Beautiful on the eyes
2019-11-07 20:51:52	This is my favorite podcast!	5	AmyFish2	Great!
2019-10-29 20:57:40	I like the show and the host Emily. However, she can be tough to listen to at times due to constantly interrupting her guest. I’d love for her to let the guest talk and ask occasional questions. At times the host also begins to talk really fast which leads to rambling and then never finishes her sentence. Many times her thoughts get jumbled up to another thought or topic and then she’s all over the place. but it can be a good show!	4	Nickname is annoyed	Ramble
2019-10-29 00:47:42	I really appreciate her style and presentation of often taboo and difficult topics! So great for keeping things spicy and real in our bedroom. Thank you Dr Emily!	5	Mary1438	Excellent  conversation’
2019-10-26 23:54:05	Love listening have learned so many do’s and don’ts	5	trucker Logan	Great show
2019-10-25 22:29:17	Such a wealth of information	5	Soul Haven	So good
2019-10-25 12:28:36	This show has taught me so much about communication, sex, and finding pleasure as a women. Thank you so much for this content! I recommend this show to all of my friends and my newly single mom.	5	716klb	All adults needs to listen to this show!
2019-10-24 21:48:42	I love learning new things from this show!	5	Christine102	Sex positive teachings
2019-10-23 03:10:16	Sex advocacy, sex positivity, sexual health and self value/worth are all such important concepts today and they’re allllllllll encompassed here! Thank you Emily!	5	zoe123456_$	Sex Positive
2019-10-05 20:43:21	This podcast has great info, sex positivity, and seeing things from all sides of the sexual spectrum.	5	flipebt	Emily and staff are great
2019-10-07 11:12:25	Spends the majority of her time promoting or talking about herself. Reminds me of the coworker who thinks they’re interesting because they like talking about sex at work.	1	Wiggles The Pig	Waste of Time
2019-09-10 01:27:04	"Such a great podcast . Very informative . Dr Emily is very well educated on subject and is very one .
My pod so far was Pamela Madsen . Just so much info on finding one selves . Keep it up Emily"	5	jenjen1209	Great podcast
2019-09-13 11:44:23	Can you imagine having sex with this anxiety-filled nut? Proof positive we need licensing for podcasts. Negative Nancy here excels at finding the worst side of anything.	1	Dominic Hendryx	Captain Killjoy
2019-09-12 10:03:13	Gynocentric. Lame content geared toward women and their problems.	1	anorganicfarmer	Not For Men
2019-09-05 15:08:59	I started listening as a lark, but this 53-year-old white male has discovered more useful information than I expected. Emily would be fun to have a beer with.	5	MJPInDC	Wow, what a nice surprise.
2019-08-24 16:48:31	Fantastic podcast! Very informative and great reminders and tips.	5	Dsmonteith	Who knew???
2019-08-17 22:45:16	"Thank you Emily for eduction
Educating this middle aged wife and helping me bring some spice into my life and marriage. Please keep on dropping knowledge!"	5	Regina Wheetie Baker	Life Changing
2019-08-22 17:50:01	Some good info and the speakers/Emily seem really fun and friendly, but it’s just so much fluff that I feel like I’m wasting a lot of time. For example, in the episode “ what’s your (sex) sign?” they literally never discussed different sex signs, they just said that it’s too hard to tell from one sign. Total waste of 50+ minutes.	2	Jukie1367	Fluff and more fluff
2019-08-05 00:40:00	Just discovered this podcast about three months ago. It is a life changer - informed, compassionate, and open, Emily makes talking about a taboo topic so much easier. I am almost seventy years old and learn something new from every episode.	5	BRC in Baltimore	One of a kind
2019-08-12 05:15:18	The guests are really good on this podcast, the topics are great too. I can hardly listen to an entire episode because Emily talks over her gas and interrupts incessantly. Just let them talk and when there’s a break in their conversation then respond. I actually had to shut off three podcast because she talks over her guest so much and I’m actually interested in hearing what they have to say, but I can’t because she’s either repeating and refreezing what they just said to her or interrupting them before their sentences over	3	Belysiamommy	Good but....
2019-08-03 18:15:14	This show is phenomenal. I usually can’t stand intros to any of my even fav podcasts but this one is fantastic haha so good, so much great information and funny. LOVE!!	5	MrsWalker1682	If you haven’t been listening I feel bad for you.
2019-07-30 16:16:23	Great show, great advice, and 2 great hosts!	5	Piper Skunky	Love Emily and Jamie

2019-07-19 06:11:29	LOVE Sex With Emily! I am nearly two years back because I listen every night at work. I’ve never felt so understood by a stranger, SWE addict!	5	MAC5543	27, Oregon
2019-07-19 15:16:06	I’ve always had issues with this show because Emily is so hard to listen to. She’s not a good host. She’s a horrible listener and constantly interrupting her guests. I don’t think her advice as much value. It’s not anything a friend couldn’t say. But it’s always been entertaining. Now it seems like more and more fluff and less meaningful or helpful content. I would like fewer episodes with higher quality. I also feel like Emily has only one right way of doing things. She doesn’t have work around for people who disagree. For example if someone were to call in with an issue around their husband watching porn the advice would be in how to become accepting of it instead of perhaps the couple finding a way to resolve the issue that doesn’t involve the false having to change her stance.	2	mrs1776	Going downhill
2019-07-03 00:27:27	Sex With Emily is highly entertaining and pretty darned informative! I’m 51 and I thought I knew it all.  But I didn’t know what I didn’t know! Highly recommend listening to this.	5	Mariel le	Highly Entertaining and Informative too!
2019-06-19 16:45:51	This is my absolute favorite podcast!! Your advice and openness is amazing and you’ve re-sparked a desire that I had to be a sex therapist for a long time. Obsessed with your podcast!! Thank you for sharing.	5	kkpowell03322	Amazing!
2019-06-13 12:35:47	I love this podcast. I have honestly learned so much and it’s just so fun to listen to!	5	127948628	LOVE
2019-06-19 04:00:41	Some useful info. Slightly geared towards straight men who are clueless about having sex with women; occasionally topics for women and queer folks. Overall, though, WAY too much off-topic banter that should be edited out in post. I usually have to skip to 8-9 minutes into the episode before they actually get into any content and not just what happened to them as they were getting their Starbucks that morning (yawn).	3	Tropsicle	Some good info
2019-06-01 20:43:02	Emily talks about and relationships like your bestie over a glass of wine! She’s funny, honest and open - I can’t recommend listening enough (especially with a partner!!)	5	cbnlilly	Favorite podcast!!
2019-06-08 23:11:54	This podcast is okay. I wish she’d save all or most of the calls for the radio. Also wish there wasn’t so many ads / her trying to sell things. Rather her just talk with people and give suggestions and tips on topics.	3	mia094	Hm
2019-05-28 17:03:21	Emily has changed my relationship for the better and helped me get into my body and explore everything sex related. Thank you for such wonderful content.	5	VeganFegan	Thank you Emily!
2019-05-17 20:04:06	After having a baby I felt my sex life needed a “pick me up.” After listening to this podcast and the show on XM, it has helped me out immensely! Thank you Dr.Emily for this enlightening podcast and such great info!	5	MegsyL19	Awesome podcast!!
2019-05-09 21:53:28	"I caught your show right after it came onto stars 109 satellite Radio. Awesome advice, learned some new thing, listen in the car when i can, also subscribed to the pod cast. Very nice job, great content.

2019-05-01 15:20:02	I like the show. It’s s lot of good information. Emily also. Tings good guests to the show.  The only thing is i felt Emily is too “impatient.” I listen to her talking to callers and s lot of time she cuts them off or makes them feel rushed.	3	Filmcraz	Good most of the time
2019-04-11 14:32:31	I love how she shares information on all things sex. She makes everything feel normal and acceptable (which it is!). I listen every week and love the variety of topics. The only criticism I have is producer Jamie’s stories go on and on. I definitely understand that you need someone as a “co host” but she is inserting herself in the show with random stories! Hate to criticize my favorite show so definitely still leaving 5 stars because Emily is the best!	5	Coleman riley	I love Emily!
2019-04-10 15:54:40	I recently started listening within the past month and this podcast changed my sex life after the very first episode. I tell all my friends to listen to this podcast. It’s great if you’re looking for new ideas, ways to spice things up, and even listen to questions about things you might feel self-conscious about! Will never stop listening.	5	sex with kenzie	Game changer
2019-03-22 00:05:01	I love Sex with Emily! I have been a long time listener & I listen here & on SerisXM channel 109! Truly revolutionary & a wonderful way to connect & open up about all the sex related things we all go through! I love that sex with Emily makes sex less taboo & more normal! Thanks! PS PICK ME!

2019-03-19 18:38:14	This podcast is a game changer!! So many outstanding pieces of advice and so much valuable information! My sex life has gone through the roof - no joke!	5	jnice5	Outstanding!
2019-03-19 12:46:07	Sex with Emily helped me find myself and at 24 years old I’ve finally felt sexually content. I never realized the things I wasn’t doing right until I started listening to the show and I’m forever grateful!	5	Roo11roo	Helped my sex life
2019-03-18 22:31:44	Started listening about 3 months ago. I really enjoy Emily and her team. Sex isn’t an easy topic to discuss for many. I appreciate how straight forward they are with all topics. They are Informative and funny at the same time. I love that they take phone calls and answer emails.  It has really helped me to realize that sex doesn’t have to be the taboo subject that I was brought up thinking it was.  Keep up the great work!	5	SuzzyP	Love this podcast
2019-03-15 22:03:02	I listen to the show on Sirius, Apple Podcast, and read on Instagram..I’m a huge fan!! Emily is always upbeat, funny, and full of amazing advice no matter what the situation is presented, I love it!	5	Its_tha_queen!	Always a great listen!
2019-03-15 13:35:24	Love this podcast!!! It’s so great to listen to a sexcast that keeps both the female & male in mind. We are ALL sexual creatures and should definitely embrace that on a daily! This is one way of getting much needed continued Sex Ed lol! Love, Love Emily and her colleagues!!!	5	Care8675309	Fun very educational program!
2019-03-15 11:56:50	This show has become instrumental in teaching me more about sexuality and giving me the courage to explore my own. My only regret is that I didn’t start listening years ago. I’m looking forward to catching up!	5	AmberPhoenyx	I wish I found this earlier!
2019-03-14 18:48:28	This podcast will teach you everything you need to know about sex without making it awkward.	5	foxtalgalaxt	Informative and Fun!
2019-03-14 18:25:21	I love listening to Sex with Emily. I could listen to her go on all day, it’s like I’m talking to my girlfriends. When I’m going through something always go to Emily’s podcasts for advice. I think she’s relatable for a very wide variety of ages. I definitely recommend listening if you haven’t already!	5	Catscats77	Best podcast
2019-03-14 14:46:24	Love the format and Emily’s voice (which is a big deal breaker for me with podcasts). There’s something in almost every single episode that I can connect with or learn from. Love it and love learning or feeling assured in what I already know/do. Thanks guys!!	5	Brdbutwootsvdme	Feel super connected!
2019-03-14 11:28:36	Emily - I am nearly 50, married 24 years and I finally just had my first G spot orgasm. I’m glowing and my hubs is smiling. Thank you, ROCK ON LADIES !	5	Gxegbjyvf	Yes!
2019-03-14 01:40:40	This is a female-friendly podcast that provides all listeners to easy-to-implement ideas. As a woman (and widow)entering the dating world again, I appreciate the tips to make everything so exciting again.	5	Makeup-Wearing Tracher	Thank you, Emily!
2019-03-13 23:41:13	This is one of my go to podcasts whenever a new episode comes out. I love the realistic advice and variety of fun topics, especially guests to the show.	5	aross6675	A fave!
2019-03-12 14:45:48	The show has a great vibe, the interviews are great. It’s great to listen to a wide range of topics! I can say I have added somethings to the bedroom that my wife thoroughly enjoys! Thanks!!	5	Jengelj	Great show!
2019-03-12 02:34:53	I love listening to this podcast. I found Emily through Lauryn from The Skinny Confidential. She was being interviewed and I have been listening to Emily ever since!! I love hearing all the topics being talked about. Being a sexual person and love trying new things i. The bedroom...this podcast gives it to me along with a lot of wisdom about sex, relationships, toys etc....	5	PleasantlyPetite	Elevating
2019-03-10 00:53:56	I love how listening to Sex With Emily helps me keep sex in the front of my mind.  I can see a difference in my relationship with my husband and our sex life because of listening to this podcast. I feel more in tune with my sexuality and more confident after listening to Emily and her expert guests. I enjoy Emily and Jaime’s voices because sound like real friends talking to you rather than trying to sound sexy or zany. I love hearing the advice they give people who call or write in. I’ve recommended this podcast to friends.	5	deltstar	Fun to listen to and I’ve learned a lot
2019-03-09 18:08:48	I always learn something new when I listen. Emily is great!	5	harwanko	Great podcast
2019-03-09 01:46:21	Love the show. Great info on making sex more enjoyable and better for both parties. Love you Emily. Keep it up. Everyone should subscribe and listen.	5	Jordious0503	Amazing
2019-03-08 12:34:26	I’ve been listening for a few months now and I really love it. Emily makes the topic of sex natural and offers helpful advice that’s easy to use!	5	kgt2019	Great podcast
2019-03-08 10:39:35	"Recently found this podcast and have been marathoning through them nonstop! The amount of knowledge and useful tips that Emily has is unbelievable. Emily and her guests always always leave me with something to think about or important facts about health that I never knew!

Thanks Emily! Keep up the hard work and congratulations on such a long running and fantastic show!"	5	SorryHP	Entertaining and Informative!
2019-03-06 00:16:06	This is a great podcast for sex advice and a variety of topics related to sex including medical issues, relationship issues, and anything related to human sexuality, arousal, emotions behind sex, etc. I like the quick run down of the topics in the beginning. I have enjoyed the guest speakers. Emily is highly educated and very personable and sweet.  I gave it 4 stars because sometimes I feel like the show is anti-marriage or anti-longterm relationships. Emily and Jamie seem to only promote the single life or that married sex life will eventually fizzle out and be boring. Or that people who are married won’t be happy unless they have an open marriage or become swingers. That couldn’t be further from the truth. I personally think committed sex is the best sex. And sorry TMI but I have been with my husband for 20 years and we have sex 5 times per week. Some people bond and have great married sex for years and years and years and don’t feel the need to switch partners when times get tough or bring extra people in the bedroom. A married cohost would really be a great addition and give more balance to the show. And also help other married listeners work through sex issues with busy schedules, jobs, and kids, and long term relationship emotions and issues, etc.	4	Lorrainek1219	Great but needs married women
2019-03-08 09:07:18	Great podcast! Entertaining, funny and so real/authentic.  Emily tells it like it is! I have learned so much and having fun practicing with my man:)	5	OC Foodie Honey	The real real!
2019-03-08 02:39:05	Emily is real, raw, and honest! Love the tips and tricks! This podcast is 🔥... just when you think you knew it all..Boom. Here comes Emily and a whole new bucket of info and insights. Just turned 40, and I feel like There is so much more to learn!!!  Get. It. Girl. Keep. The. Podcasts. Coming!!	5	Shoelover1127	LOVE. LOVE. LOVE.
2019-03-08 00:09:36	The best thing this show does is normalize talking about sex and all the different ways people experience & engage with sex and sexuality. Talking openly about sex is good for everyone and Emily can help us all practice a little more!	5	Miranda Westphal	Normalizing conversations on sex 👍
2019-03-07 23:44:56	Love this show soooooo much, I’ve learned so much! Thank you Emily!	5	cyng327	Love it!!!
2019-03-07 23:40:36	I’ve been listening to Emily since 2011. I love how Emily and the show have grown! I’ve been recommending this podcast to my [new mom] friends for relationship advice, bedroom advice, and more!	5	geewhybee	Recommended Podcast
2019-03-02 01:45:43	The podcast is great for people to express themselves when it comes to sex. There is no need to put a negative stigma on sex, and Emily is great at putting people at ease, and there are plenty of useful information. The new podcast cover is great, and definitely sexier!	5	deltapat38	Great place to share and learn about sex
2019-02-27 02:30:53	Emily is a fantastic sex educator and it makes sense why her show is getting more and more popular. Not only is she knowledgeable about helping others with sex and relationships, she is also great at helping those improve in all aspects of their social lives. Emily and her show dive right into the nitty gritty facets of sex which you can seldom hear anywhere else. She also has amazing guests for interviewing which perfectly showcase all the different avenues of keeping a relationship fresh and being a good partner as well as treating oneself with care. I think she is making a real difference in changing the stigmas of sex around the country. Keep up the great job Emily, we all love your work!	5	Slippere1	A Podcast Breaking Down Barriers

2019-01-31 06:38:10	I was in a bit of a rut and this podcast gave me so much confidence and new insight into who I am as a woman! Also, as a female who grew up with little sex education and has been seeking it from random places since, this podcast is a comprehensive collection of all areas of sexuality. Emily and her guest speakers are brilliant. Topics are pertinent and relevant and Emily puts a bubbly spin on it all. Thank you for your work!!! Also, the episodes with John Wineland are some of my favs! :)	5	KittyQB	Life changing!
2019-01-28 14:43:58	I love this show! I started listening a couple of weeks ago and I have binged about thirty episodes so far! I love the different looks that there is for sex. There is truly something for everyone here, without judgement.	5	homerbart2000	Great show
2019-01-23 16:49:06	Has tremendously helped my wife and I communication. Has given me ALOT of bedroom tips and tricks. My wife gets turned on whenever she listens to an episode. So please keep up the great work. And thanks for what you do Emily	5	Mia Maine and he Honeybun	Love Love Love Emily

2018-12-04 16:24:23	I'm loving this show! Emily has a gift for delivering the best info on sexuality while connecting to spirituality.  Thank you Emily!	5	VeronicaParker44	this show is a must!
2018-12-19 13:45:13	"I like this show but the beginning is 10 minutes of fluff about their personal lives. Luckily I have the app. And can skip the beginning.
 Can’t Emily cut it to 5 minutes of pajama party details or whatever she and her cohost talk about that is non related and get on with the show!

2018-08-27 23:30:51	I definitely enjoy listening to this podcast most of the time. It’s informative and fun and I love the discussions. The reason I give this podcast four stars instead of five is because Emily talks WAY TOO FAST. She often talks so fast she speaks nonsense and doesn’t form complete sentences so it becomes frustrating to listen to. And she talks over her guests and her co host, Menace, all the time. She never lets Menace finish his thoughts or comments, it can get really annoying. Overall, I recommend it. Just turn it off when it gets annoying.	4	GingerBio	Fun and informative BUT...
2018-11-23 19:48:22	This podcast is a life saver. As a trauma survivor, I have learned to reclaim my sexual being, without shame, through the help of this podcast. Give yourself the gift of learning to love your body, sexuality and fantasies with Emily and her amazing team. I keep telling my friends about this show because it includes everyone, is caring and promotes sex positivity. Also, my love life is better than ever. Practical tips, advice and love are a part of this as well. I love this show!! Thank you Emily and thank you to her amazing team!!!	5	Gia3313	Amazing, Helpful, Energizing
2018-11-14 17:57:48	"I love the content of this show but am having a hard time listening to Emily. As a host she’s knowledgeable but she is CONSTANTLY talking over other hosts, guests and listeners. She’ll ask a question and then continue to talk over them as they try to answer. This just totally gets under my skin. 
Might be a personal problem but I’m on the verge of looking for another podcast."	3	kriscoschron	Good content - a bit frustrated
2018-11-05 17:56:27	Just found this and have bing listened for a couple of days. It’s just what the sex doctor ordered!	5	Zoom Dweebie	Great advice!
2018-11-04 17:35:09	WORST PODCAST I HAVE EVER HEARD!!!!!!!!!!!	1	hhhskdidjd	Horrible
2018-10-17 13:07:08	I want to love this podcast because it’s a woman talking about sex and that’s fantastic. But Emily dominates (ha) every discussion, so instead of really hearing what guests have to say, it’s really Emily talking about herself and interrupting and then waiting for more chances to talk. She talks over guests. I listened to her podcast with Scott Eastwood, who seems like a cool guy with lots to say, but Emily made it all about her. I sat in my car yelling “shut up!” And then eventually gave up. If you’re too ditzy to know what SSRI stands for, you can’t speak with authority about clinical topics. It’s a shame. Emily, please learn to listen to guests instead of letting the LA narcissism loose!	3	Furrywhitecat	So promising
2018-10-12 17:51:23	Love Emily. Love this podcast.  Emily is so upbeat and positive and a pleasure to listen to. This one is a gem.	5	Ty	Love
2018-10-09 23:35:57	One of my ultimate favorite podcasts, it has really helped me through some past sexual trauma to create the sex life of my dreams. I am so excited to keep listening and learning from Emily (and her team), she is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. I am constantly recommending this to my friends, seriously take a chance and listen to it. It will change your life!	5	I'murbiggestfan	In love!
2018-10-01 22:47:05	Great topics and great explanations	5	Asaommmm	Great
2018-09-11 00:56:58	I'm all for having people discuss sex and sexuality openly, but this podcast seems to cover things that people imagine men fantasize about. And it doesn't do that too well, either. Some of the information and advice is sophomoric, and occasionally it falls into the negative traps and tropes that are common in the sex industry. There are some terrific guests, but other podcasts have covered these topics with greater sensitivity and with better information.	2	Drew McH	Information and advice is pretty superficial
2018-09-05 22:17:53	This was the best explanation of the #metoo I have ever listened to it explains a better way to communicate.	5	John Wineland episode	Leaning in

2018-08-23 10:03:03	I used to like listening to this show when Menace and Anderson was on, now it’s the same topics over and over again.  Also too many advertisements and picking emails so that you can sell more. I have unsubscribed.	1	ttcc2424	Can’t listen anymore
2018-07-24 03:37:06	For someone with a really adventurous and open parter, Emily has made it so much easier for me to open up and be able to be just as adventurous as him.	5	Jacky4423	Sexy and informative all in one
2018-07-23 18:58:17	Sex with Emily is an amazing podcast. Emily is fun, approachable, and informative. Listening to her show is like having a conversation with your best friend and your  therapist at the same time. It’s done wonders for my sexual self confidence and my relationship. Thanks Emily!	5	Rachel.LS	Liberating

I found Heather through her book ""Sex Without Pain"" and hoped she could help us when all hope felt like it was completely lost. After making a trip to see her in person twice since February, I am happy to report we have had painfree intercourse recently, and are well on our way to getting on our lives together. We owe so much to Heather and her specialized treatment process. I truly hope anyone that was once in our position finds her.

2018-06-22 16:00:07	I’ve been a listener since 2013, and just made the decision to discontinue listening to Emily. I think she has a wonderful personality, however, the show is overwhelming heteronormative and rarely discusses gay or queer sex. Please give me more (ANY) content that is inclusive of the LGBTQ+ community. Sex isn’t just for straight people, but if you listen to this podcast, it may seem like it. And truly, we never need another segment about a case of mismatched libidos.	1	OliviaR0517	Straight Sex with Emily

2018-05-09 09:33:18	Emily is a nice positive look at modern day sex and relationship talk. Seems to attract both married/singles from the older urban millennial + professional metropolitans crowd mostly. I would guess the show is 60% or so listener driven- the topics are current and relatable to most people. The podcast is clever and the host (Emily) even sounds kinda cute discussing sexual content topics too. Show has a nice calm and hip’ vibe to it too...Worth a listen+	5	AK from the 215	an Interesting + mellow cast

2018-04-30 04:33:16	The topic of sex is awesome and “all” (well mostly) that goes with it.  The topics covered are wide ranging....all aren’t my must listen too’s and truth be told some I don’t but most I/we do....I can really appreciate Emily, her staff and guests for trying to inform, educate and make something so fun and natural (sex) more enjoyable by just talking intelligently and in a fun manner about it....keep it cumming ;)	5	rsring	What’s not to appreciate.....
2018-05-06 00:48:40	Emily’s voice sounds like she’s used way too many opioids or needs to be treated for gonorrhea of the larynx.  And to have guests on her show who have the intelligence of seventh graders simply points out that this a show worth no one’s time.	1	OmgwanaKikbuti	Boring...
2018-04-26 04:57:27	"My favorite thing about this podcast is that it’s become my go-to tool to unabashedly share with ANYONE a message about sex, relationship health, personal growth and much more when the opportunity arises in conversation. I simply preface it, “Pick and choose from episodes as some may not be relevant for you.” It’s the best arms-length way to share valuable information that everyone should hear, but that you may not be comfortable conveying yourself. For example, how to tell your mother in law about the best way to fix that pee-a-little-lady problem??...Say “Have you heard of this thing called Kegal Camp from Sex with Emily?? It’s supposed to really help!"" THE POSSIBILITIES TO SHARE ARE ENDLESS!"	5	JaclynS.	Best Way to Talk About Sex with ANYONE
2018-04-27 14:47:56	This is really just ok it’s not good and it’s not bad it’s just kinda eh. I’ve tried to listen to this podcast multiple times trying to enjoy and learn but to be honest a lot of the Advice and topics are pretty basic.	2	secxhi	Very ok
2018-04-24 01:41:09	Found your podcast just recently when Jordan Harbinger was on. Love the podcast now. Very matter the fact information about sex without judgement, but with some positive humor.	5	Kelly “K-Fresh” Frazier	Love the show!
2018-04-20 03:56:52	I’m a newer listener to the show. I’ve found this podcast to be informative and entertaining. I can’t say I would be willing to try everything that I’ve listened to, but I have been challenged to evaluate my beliefs and expand my idea of what it means to pleasure my partner. Great show. Keep it going.	5	Cwp42375	Great podcast

She poses the question “how could this be?”  To which the nerd reply’s “jocks think of sports all day and nerds think about sex all day. “.

2018-04-03 21:31:08	Emily is the kind of host you immediately fall in love with. Her caring and thoughtful insight into human sexuality is both broad and up to date. Emily keeps up with the latest trends in sexual behavior and dating habits. No subject is taboo. From anal sex to BDSM. Sex with Emily knows it all. I’m both a fan and a student.

Keep up the important and AMAZING work!	5	iheadley	This Podcast is for EVERYONE
2018-02-19 04:20:45	Emily has a great voice for podcasting, and she’s a great interviewer, but every guest seems to make generalizations that Emily just...lets go by without challenging them. I just had to turn off an episode because the guest said men are always ready for sexual, “as the wind blows,” and both women happily agreed. Are you kidding me? It’s 2018. This podcast is for sheltered white ladies and doesn’t seem to have an understanding of sex beyond their personal experiences. Needs diversity of viewpoint, fast!	2	EmilyvstheGorn	Who is this for?
2018-02-16 20:46:35	As much as I love the valuable guest and information you provide on your show I would like to suggest a guys perspective to bring balance & feedback. There are often times where you lean more to the female view and the male opinion can be missed. I know you have a few men on but some can be soooo vanilla that the show hinders the progress. I know it’s the Sex with Emily show I am just saying this would be a great change. Thank you.	3	Hella Good music listener	The adjustment.
2018-02-11 16:27:22	Emily provides a great, sex positive perspective that is quite often missing from public discourse.	5	SylvanJared	Great, Open Info on Sex
2018-02-10 23:55:05	I love this podcast so much. Emily is filled with knowledge and great ideas. She has excellent guests on the show and I love when she answers listener emails. I listen to this show whenever I’m driving in my car, or at home cooking or cleaning. It’s fun and entertaining to have on in the background. I’m so glad there are lots of episodes for me to binge!!	5	Sopholaaaaa	Thank you Emily!
2018-01-29 23:35:05	Stopped listening because it’s the same questions and answers over and over again.  Emailed a few questions she never answered, too	3	KK77888	Redundant
2018-01-11 19:42:42	"Emily and her guests provide some incredibly compelling and actionable content on how to get on the right track to an invigorating and rewarding relationship.

Highly recommend listening and subscribing to Sex With Emily if you want the knowledge AND mindsets to re-examine your own relationships and make sure they are as healthy as can be!"	5	J. Barshop	Awesome show, highly recommend!
2017-12-25 17:09:07	I have been listening on and off for what seems like a decade. To be honest, there are too many episodes, and I have to be in the mood to listen, but when the time is right, this show satisfies. I usually prefer the more gabby episodes actually, where Emily and co talk about their lives. I think the Menace and Anderson are my favorite, but I know people are divisive on them. If you are looking for a highly structured show, you may want to go elsewhere. But this show has many peaks along with the valleys.	3	SquareBiz539	Good show to drop in on
2017-12-14 18:13:17	This podcast was recommended based on some others I listen to through iTunes, and so far, I've really enjoyed it. Most of the episodes I've listened to are from 2016-present. Some of the older ones caught my eye title-wise, but the format was evidently very different and I couldn't get through them. The mix of live call-ins and emailed questions makes for an interesting listen because it seems no one writes the question they really want answered and so much more comes out in conversation. Emily has a very woman-friendly approach to exploration and discovery, something that I didn't find in the Savage Love Cast. I like that Emily spends time connecting the mental and emotional elements of relationships to the physical expression through sex. There are advertizements to other sites and products but you know what? They are good products. I'd been looking for a gentle toy cleaner and Emily's shop had just the hting. If she gets royalties from that stuff, she has good taste in choosing what she wants associated with her brand/show.	4	Matadequin	Current format is good!
2017-12-19 21:20:38	I cant begin to tell you how awesome Emily and her staff are with each podcast! Not every episode will be a hit with you, therefore; listen often and give it a chance and you will eventually find beauty in each episode! My wife and I listen often and use it as conversation started since she would seldom talk about sex! You ROCK Emily(and the team too!)	5	Novaes	AWESOME-NESS
2017-12-14 20:29:54	I love listening to Emily and her guest. I get great advise and referred to new toys.. cant beat that😁 thanks Emily	5	2babiesOMG	Best Advise and Ideas
2017-11-27 05:43:36	I’m always learning something new when I listen to Emily’s podcasts.  She has an amazing list of exciting guests, most of which I have never heard of but i find myself feeling thankful I took the time to listened to👍.	5	Cupcakekitten94	Always More To Learn
2017-11-29 04:29:51	Excellent show when Menace and/or Anderson were on every week to provide a guy's perspective. When Emily does the show alone or with women guests the podcast is just unlistenable for men.	3	Leagleoh	Failing Guys
2017-11-23 06:01:00	Emily keeps things interesting, full of laughs and entertaining!	5	AK Bordagaray	Educational & Funny!
2017-11-21 02:00:13	Avid listener. Highly recommend Emily’s podcast for all..single, dating, married, straight, gay, or unsure..this podcast is for you!	5	Andrea4483	Amazingly insightful, positive, & entertaining
2017-11-21 01:55:59	This is a really good movie it was so sexy.	5	Jays😘😍🤗	Sex with Emily
2017-11-16 12:12:34	Great content with a no nonsense and nonjudgmental approach to anything and everything related to sex, love, and relationships.	5	armistead.anna	Entertaining and Informative
2017-11-15 21:03:16	This podcast is the most well balanced and informative podcast on sex, relationships and life around. If you are looking for informed solutions, intriguing conversations and literally how to have the best sex throughout your life, don’t miss it!!!!!!	5	Kubbyyogi	Sex with Emily. The go to for all things “O”mazing!
2017-11-03 07:57:25	Emily is BY FAR the BEST SEX ED TEACHER I have EVER had!! I was told by a friend about this podcast and I have been hooked ever since! Emily not only gives the BEST advice but she also makes you feel like you are not alone with all your problems, questions and fears. I've learned so much and have taken her advice to heart.... and bed!! Thank you so much Emily, you're the BEST!!! ❤️	5	jerseygrl5	THE BEST SEX ED IVE EVER HAD!!
2017-09-21 19:25:06	The show is incredibly repetitive, and feels like it's mostly geared towards heterosexuals. I don't feel like there's much variety to it, and when she brings on guests they often don't add much to the show (when Lynette Corrola was on, and was intoxicated and brought absolutely no value to the show). I much prefer listening to Savage love!	4	justbad.	Meh
2017-11-02 17:26:08	Very informative and entertaining. Every week I look forward to Sex with Emily!	5	Hillbilly Nightmare	Sex-cellent!!
2017-10-31 20:16:30	Emily is a very likable, well – informed and non-judgmental sex advice host. That's a fun, interesting topics with no attempt to make the listener feel guilty about being a sexual person. Great show!	5	Listener FL	Wonderful and informational
2017-10-25 19:35:14	I've been listening for almost a year now, I remember Emily from Love Line back in the day, and her show is always a treat to listen to. It's entertaining, sexy, but also really informative and reassuring. This past episode about masculinity was AMAZING! As a child and a teen I struggled with my anger issues, nowadays I'm a lot more chill, but I still struggle with depression now and then. That episode really resonated with me, even if I have a completely different story. Thank you Emily and Co. Once I get my business and everything up and going, I actually would love to get into podcasting (and maybe even being a guest on the show? Who knows!) thank you again for what you do, I recommend this show to anyone and everyone.	5	Criss charming	Absolutely love it
2017-10-17 16:14:25	This pod cast and the topics covered are awesome. The matter of fact approach and the openness of the guests is refreshing. It has given me confidence to open up to my spouse about likes, dislikes etc. by helping me realize everything is normal.	5	Rhino516	Great Pod Cast
2017-10-15 18:22:43	"I’ve been an empty marriage for too long. Emily’s expertise with relationships and approach to sex, have open my mind to the possibilities of starting a new relationship. Also, too many people have a close mind to sex. Emily’s approach is exciting and educational. I’m so glad she is dispensing this information. Her podcast should be played every where. 

I’m listening from California by Apple podcast."	5	Screwflappybird4838	Show review
2017-10-13 20:01:21	Not dirty. Informative, frank talk about sex and making sex better.	5	turkhaven	The best sex podcast.
2017-10-12 14:55:30	Finally!! An honest talk show about what we all want to know about.....SEX. I learn new things and have implemented her suggestions to an amazingly honest sexual relationship with my fiancé. Thanks Em!	5	Katholbrook	LOVE this podcast
2017-10-08 20:40:51	The show is easy to get into and Emily does a fantastic job of making some very intimate subjects fun to listen to and learn about. Thanks Emily, guests and staff for the candid, helpful subjects and the mature yet lighthearted way they are presented.  Six stars out of five!	5	ListenerX2	We love Emily!
2017-10-05 18:35:51	Emily is relatable, genuine, and sweet. She is gentle with people who ask for advice but definitely tells them how it is which is amazing. Listening to her and her guests talk about their own sex experiences has inspired me to try new things and broaden my horizons and has in turn made me more confident. I think Emily is a great role model for younger women like myself.	5	Boomboxsays	My favorite podcast.
2017-10-05 16:57:56	Love Emily!	5	Yo board but ok	Favorite podcast
2017-10-04 21:25:49	Emily Thank you for your service..	5	DJMS4	Amazing
2017-10-04 13:40:11	I really like this podcast, Emily’s perspective on things is very interesting that it always gives me something to consider with my personal relationships	5	TheeKingDem	Thought I would jump ship after one episode
2017-10-04 12:19:47	I wish she'd stop letting Anderson on her show, though. He is awful and rude and offensive and annoying. Better guests, Emily. You're wonderful.	5	Shley133	I love Emily
2017-09-19 06:18:02	Emily, please slow down and stop interrupting people. It makes the guests feel like they also have to talk fast just to be able to say anything and then I have to stop and make sure I didn't hit the 2x speed button.	4	Mary murderina	SHHHHH
2017-09-21 10:43:45	Wife and I absolutely love the show. Two or three days a week we take a nice 2 hour long drive after work to the coast. We listen and discuss the topics with them. Dr. Emily's show has opened up our communication and improved every aspect of our life. Great show especially for young adults/late teens. I wish I could have learned this stuff at much younger age.	5	omg_lol_2004	our ears ring with pleasure
2017-09-13 03:32:50	I listened to your podcast about master bating and noticed my girlfriend was really stressed, so I asked her if she knew how to master bate and she said no. Then I told her how and she was so happy and great full it made me feel great! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!	5	#Jesusistheanswer	YOUR THE BEST!!!!
2017-09-09 11:55:25	This podcast is amazing because Emily clearly loves to make it!	5	Degenerate News	Amazing
2017-08-29 16:18:06	I absolutely love this podcast! I love hearing Emily answer everyone's emails and especially when she has guests on the show. I love hearing everyone's different views on sex topics. I have learned so much and become more comfortable with talking about sex with my boyfriend and asking for what I need and want in bed. Thank you so much for that Emily!! You are awesome!  I've even got all my friends listening now too:)	5	Organically Violet	My FAVORITE podcast!!
2017-07-31 14:30:30	Emily is so entertaining and informative! I'm learning so much from her! This show is helping me take my sex life to a whole other level!	5	philwhiteley	I love this Podcast!
2017-07-27 00:54:04	The show is more comedy/banter than informative sex education.  It is entertaining but not so educational.  It has opportunity to be better but The side banter of dopey guests like Menace and Anderson sink the show.  Emily you are better solo.	4	daniellpaul	Occasionally a morsel of useful info
2017-07-23 22:27:17	I love listening to this show, it makes long road trips way more fun. Emily is a true professional and always offers great advice without being harsh or judgmental. Plus I love that she's an entrepreneur! The show has recommended many tips and toys that have helped my relationship and sex life. Emily and the staff are great and I can tell they're passionate about what they do. Thanks for helping so many people!	5	Allybrie	Love!
2017-07-19 17:59:02	I always enjoy listening to Emily answer questions with no judgement!	5	AmberM121	Emily does a great job creating a safe space
2017-07-23 11:09:04	"I listened to this thinking it was gonna be something entertaining. And it was for a little while. But it got dull real quick. I feel the whole show is jst this chick bringing her friends on and talk about how awesome they are. Her advice isn't anything great. I feel like you can do a simple google search and get the same advice in stead of wasting you're time writing to her. All she talks about is communication is lubrication and giving BJs or eating out. And constant pitches for her "" sponsors"". Unless your bored at work or something I wouldn't waste the wifi or battery life or even any bit of my unlimited data to down load these pod casts."	1	Moneyzz12343	No longer a listener
2017-07-22 22:10:53	Do you like commercials? I'm not talking about Superbowl quality, I'm talking about the exact same one over and over and over and draaaaaawn out! This entire podcast revolves around a brand (I'm not going to continue advertising it for her) it starts with it, ends with it, she mentiones it during the show and even chooses callers (maybe even stages it!) who have questions that can be answered with her toy or lube advice. They all have to make a buck, it's a free podcast after all, but when the content is all about your advertising, it's ridiculous.	1	Early Bronk	Giant Infomercial
2017-07-18 20:40:50	I'm surprised to read so many negative reviews but I personally find Emily super helpful and educating with it comes to sex and trying new sexual experiences. Keep up the good work team!	5	Asmith061	Love love love
2017-07-13 00:38:08	I love the podcast and Emily is really down to earth and answers your quesions without judgement.	5	Quicksticks17	Emily Rocks!
2017-07-07 16:27:00	"Have listened for 10 years and learned so much that has translated into a much better sex life.
Go emily"	5	indiana doc	Great listen
2017-07-12 13:52:12	I refused to think or talk about sex until I started listening to Sex With Emily. Now, I LOVE every episode that's released: tips for the bedroom, advice for relationships and so much more! I event went as far as sending in my own question and she answered on the show (I was a little star-struck). If you have sex/relationship questions, concerns or just want to learn more about such a taboo topic, Sex With Emily is your place to go!	3	PnkAnchor	THE BEST
2017-07-11 18:23:46	Thinly veiled sexism, useless advice, uncaring hosts only interested in their own ideas and egos. Look elsewhere.	1	Xenodeus	Cosmo style trash show
2017-07-05 22:10:58	Can't recommend this highly enough.	5	Brad Simmerman	Informative and frank discussion of sex
2017-06-28 22:11:20	This is a great and informative show.  Emily is open minded and willing to answer any sex or relationship question.  I would highly recommend this show!	5	Angel gone wrong	Great show
2017-07-03 13:59:49	I've listened to this podcast for over a year and I've just about had enough with Emily. Her advice can be good but her delivery is awful. She has good ideas on how to increase confidence surrounding sexuality which has helped me. However, she constantly talks over and interrupts her guests to put in her two cents- the problem is she talks so fast you can't understand either person, and this happens throughout the ENTIRE episodes. The guests have interesting and valuable things to say and the interrupting is just her trying to say it first to make herself look good. Emily- check your ego and let your guests talk.	2	E.set	Annoying
2017-06-27 18:54:38	I love Sex with Emily!  It's a great show and I listen every week.	5	Egg1523	Awesome Show!
2017-06-23 21:13:16	Emily is witty and fun to listen to. Her guests are informative and entertaining. I have certainly become more comfortable communicating with my wife about sex as a result of listening to the show.	5	divarunner	Fun and informative
2017-06-23 20:33:13	Love listening to this podcast twice a week!	5	Small Town Girl 44	Love
2017-06-20 20:53:39	When I first started listening years ago I wasn't all that impressed. I came back to it to give it another try and I was happy to hear that Emily had found her style.  She sounds  more professional and she and her guest seem to just click.  It makes me feel that I am sitting listening to friends having a conversation  and her topics keep me coming back. Emily has giving me great ideas and information that has made our sex life better than ever.	5	nor cal tj	gets better  every podcast
2017-06-19 04:18:02	Very intelligent discussion, not sophomoric at all.  Lots of variety in topics.	5	kcorum	Excellent!
2017-06-15 17:11:45	Emily's voice is so soothing to listen too and she gives some really great advice, she does a great job of de-shaming sex talk.	5	Cmessthe1st	Love this show
2017-06-07 22:33:51	I love Emily and her non-intimidating advice and guidance! She has guided me to change my marriage for the better! You Rock, Emily!	5	Kimber9696	So Helpful!
2017-03-01 17:37:16	I really like the show but menace KILLS IT. Bring on Matthew hussey or any other guy who knows what they're talking about. Definitely has improved since the older episodes I've listened to. Menace always manages to bring conversations to either a judgmental place or an off topic boring one.	4	Dearhahshshahhahansbnensns	Please get rid of menace
2017-05-23 23:55:13	Enjoy the show and good tips	5	littlepiggypan	Love it
2017-05-23 20:28:30	I always get solid practical knowledge for both relationships and sex from Q&A with listeners and life experiences from the hosts of the show. They know what they are talking about because they live it on a daily basis. The show I'm talking about in particular spoke to me because I'm the epitome of the target market. But it's so relatable across the board whether it's the double standard with gender or the age gap, etc. Pure excellence.	5	PMart0926	Good show overall; May 23, 2017 show was fire.
2017-05-12 17:54:36	"Please ever have joana angel on ever again
Many of your fans don't care about jew girls with blacks she's gross"	1	Wednesdaysalguero	Joana angel
2017-05-06 15:23:58	I've listened to at least a dozen episodes, both old and new, and I don't think I've learned a thing about sex. Emily spends way too much time shilling her products and sponsors, even inserting ads into conversations with guests in a way that's not at all subtle or tasteful. Her co-host Menace seems to have the IQ of a lima bean, and the only people this podcast could possibly be enlightening for are those who are unaware of the existence of lube.	2	souplessbitch	I don't want to buy your chafing cream.
2017-04-24 21:05:25	No valid information. Speakers sounded uneducated and judgemental	1	Lizzierosemedia	Didn't even get to the topic til the end
2017-04-22 13:14:06	"I'll give it this much - the podcast is very frank and doesn't shy away from topics.  Unfortunately, it *does* shy away from providing clear information, staying focused on a topic, and having a sense of humor.

Oh, and as a bonus, some of the most annoying, affected voices you've ever heard on a podcast."	1	Oblio88	Frank but not much more
2017-04-18 12:29:32	Menace is the smartest person on the show, they need to stop putting out more episodes that have less content.	2	TaipeiCruz	Repetitive

2017-03-21 16:33:05	My wife and I listened to an episode together, (one I thought she would be able to relate too) that night, by far the best sex either of us have had. Although my wife says it had nothing to do with the podcast, she did things she had never done before! Sexually empowered women are... yummy! Keep up the good work.	5	42lovinglife	Married sex after 40
2017-03-16 03:27:57	I love the energy of this show. Always interesting and upbeat. Can Dr. Drew come back soon?	5	MontereyMadeline	Emily is the best
2017-03-09 22:51:40	My girlfriend introduced me to this podcast and I listened to an episode with her and we both become obsessed very quickly, religiously listening to each new episode as they came out. This went for on for about 2 months or so until the sheen really started to come off. We both slowly fell off and no longer listen to the show. While I'm not going to pretend that I'm a master in the bedroom, I feel like I never truly learned anything from the episodes (To be fair we do keep a bottle of lube in the nightstand now). Though each episode description boasts interesting topics, the advice usually comes in three forms. First will be the same basic advice dolled out over and over, second will be advice that only pertains to a listeners specific question and scenario, and third will be some kind of product that we're supposed to buy. The last one is definitely the most popular, and while I'm sure there are plenty of couples that are interested in sex toys, me and my girlfriend don't want to buy any of the straps or vibrators or whatever that Emily seems to constantly be shilling. I guess what I was looking for from this podcast was more in depth discussion and techniques that we could try in the bedroom, but all I got was a lackluster advice column that doubled as an infomercial.	2	cheeaaboi	not what I had hoped
2017-02-03 02:09:22	"I know a lot of other reviews on here like to give this podcast very few stars because of Menace. That is unfair. Emily herself is positive, upbeat, and completely non discriminatory of all of her listeners needs and fantasies. She NEVER judges, and she has amazing answers for the hardest questions.

I'm not going to sugarcoat it. Menace is closed minded, a terrible fit for the podcast, and generally annoying. However, he's been appearing much less lately on the podcast. I'd give it a listen! Her other co hosts such as Madison and Anderson are great! Don't let Menace turn you off."	4	renabanena	Emily is the best, Menace is the worst
2017-02-23 11:23:07	The show content is GREAT, the guests are for the most part interesting, etc. BUT the AUDIO QUALITY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT! The levels are way to low, not even, etc. Also more Anderson please (he can fix the lacking audio as well) :-)	3	ALRUI	Love The Show, But....
2017-02-06 22:43:48	This pod cast has totally helped our intimacy! We both listen and it opens up our communication. Our sex live has gone through the roof!! Thanks Emily!	5	Cbryantlucy	Marriage
2016-12-28 22:52:16	"Having trouble bringing up certain topics concerning sex and relationships?  Leave this podcast on and Emily will start it for you.  I have the most interesting conversations in my car, that's for sure 😬.  Content and execution has gotten so much better in the later episodes!  Menace and Anderson could be off putting at times, however they give this show an edge in the sense that they reflect the ""everyday guy's "" opinion, whom Emily's work is aimed to educate.  No relationship is the same, and she treats them as such as she answers questions.  Love her!  Go Emily!"	5	Aspiring Sex Therapist	Inspired
2016-12-28 08:24:22	This has been my favorite podcast for a looonnnngggg time now. I never get tired of listening!	5	Kitten Rage	Love!!!
2016-12-24 12:03:31	Great show! My husband and I listen to it all the time while on road trips or while cooking. Love listening to email responses	5	DragonIndy	Love it
2016-12-22 18:33:37	"Fun, often silly and some educational info to be heard, long time listener of Loveline so I love the addition of Anderson to this podcast. 
Keep up all the great work, Emily! I actually knew some of the products at a sex shop thanks to your show."	5	Another Momma	Always enjoy the pod
2016-12-22 13:26:40	Half of the episodes are spent plugging products and advertising something. It's really annoying constantly hearing about sex toys, that's not why people are here listening.	2	TannerLogan23	Way too much advertisment
2016-11-17 14:57:17	Emily has a great voice and she has so much information. I have learned a lot from listening to the show!	4	Stacye35	Informative and fun!
2016-12-14 15:02:48	I've listened for quite a while.  Sometime in the last several weeks, the audio level has gotten so low, I have to turn up the volume to around 3/4 to full to hear the conversation.  I listen to a decent variety of podcasts, and all of the others have consistent and comparable volume levels.  Please match the audio level of other podcasts!	3	Chris_of_co	Needs better production quality

2016-11-01 21:31:23	Thank you for all of the advice from you and your staff. This podcast is not just about sex it's about relationships and human interaction and everyday life. I have learned an awful lot over the past 6 months of listening.	5	WalkinDude71	Always great no matter the subject
2016-09-16 01:19:35	I love how blunt Emily is. I have felt insecure speaking about sex but since listening to this show it has helped me open up.	4	Enthusiasticrunner	Very informative!
2016-10-22 23:24:22	Okay, Menace.  Here's your review.  I love this podcast.  I feel like my whole world has changed since I began listening a year ago.  Co-hosts Menace and Anderson offer great counter-points.  Together with Emily, they are relatable and entertaining.  One of my favs.	5	GetLowReign	Finally, my review.

2016-10-17 22:47:58	I tried listening to this podcast and got through 3 1/2 episodes before deciding it just wasn't for me. I found the hosts self-involved and unfocused and felt that their advice was too simplistic in many cases. Also, it's super heteronormative which rubs me the wrong way (even though I am a straight woman). There are WAY better sex podcasts out there such as the Huffpost Love and Sex podcast!	1	missElissy	Self-involved and heteronormative
2016-10-08 16:02:13	I enjoyed a few episodes for a while but it seemed - she didn't really cover certain topics - like dating other races, dating someone taller, dating people with kids, approaching confident people, the right way to breakup, how to deal with racist households etc - I didn't like the fact she didn't write me back on Twitter or Add me back on Snapchat - fans have no input - 1 way highway ( trash )	1	Hbzie	"On / Off ""Vibes"""
2016-09-28 03:17:16	Interesting show with current topics.  Emily is very knowledgeable and fun to listen to. I liked Anderson as the co-host.  Felt he offered a lot to the show.  Menace was  boring (sorry!)	5	Femi So Foxy	Yasssss!
2016-09-25 19:00:16	"I like hearing a show on sex from a woman's perspective. The format needs to be rethought. Here are my thoughts:
1. The ads are to obvious and overwhelm the entire production. 
2. Listener letters need to be addressed in a tighter more succinct approach. 
- 3 minutes each or less unless you can get them on the phone. 
- if you can get them on the phone then draw an emotional response. Tears and joy work especially if they happen in the call. 
3. Guest product placement is also too loose. No more than 10 minutes and kick them off. 

A new producer will take this show to the next level."	2	HMSS_007	Good Concept
2016-09-25 04:01:43	Listening to this podcast is like going to a concert where a great headliner intentionally has a lousy intro band to make them look better.  Emily is interesting enough and mostly gives thoughtful sound advice.  Her advice is however really geared towards young straight people. Her male sidekicks though are awful.  How does being a loud radio guy make you an informed person who should be giving out relationship or sex advice?  None of my male friends are as narrow minded and knucklheaded as Menance, Anderson, Woody, etc....  Emily should go solo and sometimes bring in real and interesting experts in the field.	2	Mpls Marc	Just OK
2016-09-25 01:05:44	"1. Quit hawking stuff. Between the website, candles, goodvibes it's all one commercial. I've only listen to 3 podcast.

2. Don't talk over each other. The interview with Nina Hartley was like they were challening each other as who will stop talking first. Let the guest talk!

3. The sound guy has nothing interesting to say, period."	2	zillow111us	This should be a 20 minute podcast
2016-09-24 05:14:38	The titles of her episodes sound great and enticing, but she just chit chats with Menace and never gets to the subject of the episode.	1	GregPing	So much promise--but no delivery
2016-09-09 15:25:33	Fantastic great voice Emily. Menace so hilarious. Anderson very good.	5	Themanfromtaured24	Great
2016-09-08 18:09:47	I absolutely love this show and would recommend it to any podcast listener	5	North west guy	Just fantastic
2016-08-26 17:24:09	"I first heard Emily on Love Line and decided to give her podcast a listen. I've been listening for several months now and absolutely love it! I've gone back and listen to old episodes and never miss the new ones. 
I'm not sure what some of these other views are talking about. Maybe they're just all the reviews and the show has gotten much better, but I absolutely love Emily and Menace. They are funny while being informative and seem to make a great team since they do have some different opinions from time to time. I also enjoy that Anderson from Love Line occasionally makes appearances on the show. 
Keep up the great work Emily and Menace!"	5	TheIssa	Great podcast - informative and entertaining!
2016-08-26 05:46:24	"The other sex podcast I've listened to forever has been running 16 years, but this one I just discovered has also been around forever, with 11 years of history.  Totally different style.  Susie is the ""NPR of Sex"" whereas this is ""lighter"" and has very little sexual politics, if just as much sex advice, and more dating discussion.   It has some ads, but it is free.  I've listened to the latest dozen episodes and really enjoy the interplay between the two hosts.  It's also heavy on listener questions, which I enjoy.  I'm pretty well versed in the literature, and all the advice I've heard so far is solid."	5	radellaf	Almost as Venerable as Susie Bright
2016-07-12 19:05:20	I love how fun and upbeat this show is and I've learned a lot.	4	JoelShooter	Great show
2016-08-25 14:48:02	I've given this one a couple of shots, and it's just not for me. All I can hear through Emily's valley girl vocal fry and Menace's bro-talk is narcissism. They don't seem to (or seem to desire to) relate to the audience in any way. It's Kardashianesque, if you're into that type of train wreck.	1	Philosomist	Bleh
2016-08-24 20:46:42	Good stuff	5	syzygus556	Love it

2016-08-07 02:35:17	Tried listening after several months break and you guys are the worst. Anderson is disgusting and Emily is so entitled. Never again! Don't listen!!!!	1	OhioA1982	The worst!
2016-08-04 18:45:45	My co worker sent me this podcast after a breakup- now im addicted! I love listening to this at work as im at my computer all day. I love her voice its up beat and fun unlike a lot of the other podcasts.	5	Kendra3813:	love this

2016-07-31 14:05:25	"I have been listening to this podcast for over a year now - I love it.  I look forward to my two new episodes being delivered every week

Some shows are better than others but I find all of them entertaining and funny. Emily provides answers to questions and provides insight into how people might be thinking about sex"	5	Bethhalli	A Fun Podcast

2016-07-27 19:02:29	I love this podcast. Was first introduced to Emily from Loveline on KROQ.  Now that Loveline is gone, I needed a new outlet. Sex With Emily is interesting, funny and very insightful. I relate to every episode in some way or another. I've only been listening for a couple months and it's been improving my relationship by giving me life hacks on communication and intimacy. Definitely give it a try. Emily is quirky and a smart beauty.	5	Emilyalice	My therapy
2016-07-22 23:00:51	"Emily is great...""Menace"" acts like a 17 year old horny clown. Ruins the podcast."	3	jvtodd_2003	Sidekick is terrible
2016-07-22 21:44:14	Listen to Emily is so amazing . I have learnt a lot about me both sexually and physical.	5	rozviprincess	Learned a lot about myself
2016-07-21 16:35:32	Has its peeks, but too many deep valleys... boring, pushing products and simply like to talk about themselves.  Ugh!  Painful.	1	SeattleBetsy	Ugh!
2016-07-11 17:26:05	Honestly I really enjoy listening to this podcast.  I have a VERY long train commute and rather than listening to peoples screaming children or drug addicts having mental breakdowns, I listen to Emily talk about a wide variety of topics.  I see many people complaining about the fact that its never ending plugs for products, but come on.  The show has to be funded somehow.  Its a free podcast, so of course its going to have sponsors.  At least the plugs are generally pretty relevant to what they are talking about.  Also, people complain that she constantly talks about how hot she is and how Venace (or Menace?, I dont know) is narrow minded and full of himself.  I personally don’t think these things are bad, people are allowed to be confidence beleive it or not.  I think people are threatended that she is confident and doesn't need listener approval,  but thats just my opinion.  The only downside that I really think this show has is that Emily talks super fast and kind of slurs all her words together.  She needs to enunciate better, but you do get pretty used to her talking the more you listen.  Over all I really enjoy this show and I find it fun and interesting to listen to.	4	Fiona121314151617181920	Fun and Interesting!
2016-06-02 06:43:27	Hi. Really enjoy this podcast. Only gave it 4 stars because sometimes she talks way too fast or they waste too much time in the beginning getting into topics. I listen to Menace on The Woody show everyday. He's nicer on TWS than he is on SWE but it's nice hearing a different side of him. I wish he'd open up more and just talk. He kinda seems guarded but I would too if I was on the radio. Anyway, it's worth giving a listen.	4	Nikkidavs714	Really enjoy this podcast
2016-07-10 02:29:21	Love the show, very informative.	5	CHP lizz	Informative

2016-06-27 11:23:59	"I had such high hopes for this podcast, as someone who is brand new to the dating world after surviving a turbulent divorce - and an even more turbulent marriage - I need all the help and insight I can get on how to navigate this new singles world I'm now in... 

That said - I actually think that there is a considerable amount of potential for this podcast to be pretty dang good - if not great... So I sincerely hope that the constructive critisism that I am about to give - will not hurt anyones feelings, as I offer it with my upmost respect and regard to Emily, her show, guests and fellow co-hosts...  

Ok, so with that said... 

First things first... Ms. Emily - You tend to disrupt and talk over your guests and co-hosts quite a bit... I noticed in just about ever episode I listened to that they can only get in  1-2 sentences before you cut them off with your thoughts / opinions on whatever it is that they are trying to say... This ends up with so much talking over one another, that it gets pretty agravating for us listeners who are trying to take in everything that you guys are saying...

Secondly - While the advertising and product promoting might be the bread and butter of what keeps The Sex With Emily Podcast going - I feel that there is quite a bit of time speant on promoting / pitching these products, which can be very off putting as it begins to feel a bit pushy, sales pitchy, and at times - comes off as if you are almost badgering your audience to buy these products. 

There is no doubt that you are an incrredibly smart, beautiful, and vibrant woman - your confidence and charisma is genuinely inspiring. The wealth of knowledge that you have to offer to those of us who want to learn from you is limitless and I think with a some tweeking and repositioning  - you will be an insurmountable asset to countless people who"	1	KelleyMack	Obnoxious...
2016-06-26 04:04:18	Emily is so sweet and knowledgable. Love her and all the great advice she gives.	5	Dtrockcity505	Live for Emily
2016-06-23 22:12:48	Shows great. Keep up the good work	5	Emilylavamp	Great stuff
2016-06-21 11:32:37	I'm a sexuality educator. Was totally turned off when in the first episode I listened to, Emily described the Kinsey scale as a scale from 1 to 10. Kinsey's scale as he originally conceived of it was from 0 to 6...it's ludicrous that someone running a sex podcast doesn't know this. Also, the cohosts have a poor understanding of math/statistics based on some of their statements about surveys.	1	ENMster	inaccurate...
2016-06-20 06:31:38	Since Loveline ended, Sex With Emily has become one of my favorite shows. Although not identical it has a lot of informative information, but can often be repetitive. All in all an entertaining show, with a variety of guest giving different views.	5	TheeBreh	Since Loveline Ended
2016-06-17 05:23:43	I love this podcast. I have gotten all of my friends to listen to it. The advice is straight forward and the special guest are always awesome.	5	zaplington	Best sex podcast
2016-06-13 11:56:54	"I see a bunch of one & two star reviews and I'm glad I didn't see them until now. 

SWE is part entertainment and part information. And you have to be a) smart enough to parse that; b) comfortable with sometimes raunchy material; c) willing to listen  to sometimes way (way) different views of sex and d) looking for answers to questions you didn't know to ask. 

She has some very interesting, in every sense of the word, guests and topics that will have you saying either ""wow"" or ""huh?""

There are clunker shows but everything in life is like that. But if you don't usually take something away then you're likely too jaded to have even read this far. 

This five star has nothing to do with me winning the week with Em at Hedonism. 😜"	5	dmpyron	Fun and informative
2016-06-05 16:35:16	It's just plain bad to listen to.	1	Smxyshwldbs	Disappointed
2016-06-03 22:27:11	Emily, Menace, and Anderson are very entertaining while giving you ways to spice up your sex-life and answering listeners . If you like sex and want to get better at it give sex with Emily a try. You won't be disappointed.	5	Shawn_1021	I love sex with Emily

2016-05-24 00:31:08	Back in the day, Emily actually discussed sex and addressed questions or themes relating to the subject. Now, the podcast spends about 20 mins just talking about her life with bad co-hosts with bite sized discussion on sex. Unsubscribed.	1	Newportchris	Gossip with a side of talk
2016-05-19 12:41:08	It makes me so happy to hear that I'm not the only one in the world that wants to learn everything about sex and pleasure. I love Emily and Menace and Anderson.

2016-05-16 20:30:44	Sex With Emily is one of the best podcasts that has ever happened to me.  I did a search for proper kegel help and found this podcast along with Emily's kegel app!   I love how passionate Emily and Menace are about helping people everywhere with their sexual issues, fantasies and realities.  There is a lot of conversation to start out each podcast, but I like that it doesn't sound scripted or forced and that these are real people helping others get more enthusiastic about all things bedroom and self-love related.  I love that I can submit questions and even entries to contests.  Fantastic show!	5	MarlaSinger	Learning something new with every episode!
2016-05-17 16:51:01	I used to like this show. The content was edgy and current. Now it's laden with ads and self promotion.	1	Kel Dogg	It's just one big commercial
2016-05-14 00:17:14	I enjoy this podcast a lot. The host, Dr. Emily Morse, presents a very professional podcast. She has a wonderfully playful sense of humor and a very nice voice. She also talks about things that some of us could never say out loud, and gets her guests to open up about their lives. The podcast has taught me a lot and made me think a lot.	5	joaquin600	Excellent podcast!

It is presented in a fast and fun banter that makes me look forward to the next podcast."	5	JTWells	Fun and Educational
2016-04-29 03:00:38	The hosts are annoyingly superficial and self centered. They don't even offer advice but seem to spend the whole show talking about themselves. If you like rape jokes and hate intelligence this is the show for you. The rest of us will move on to something worth listening to. Emily, I'm so embarrassed for you!	1	Elizap123	No no no!!!
2016-04-24 12:55:31	How can you not love Emily? She's smart, funny, and ever so charming. This show never has a dull moment. I listen to both shows every week and I've learned so much over the years. This show is for everyone. Single, dating, married, in a relationship, male or female. Everyone can pick up a few tricks. I couldn't live without this podcast.	5	laurenlove2420	Best Sex Show

2016-04-11 10:06:47	I love listening to Emily and her co-hosts. Funny and caring and without judgement. While there are subjects that I'm just not into, for the most part I'll pick-up good advice every week on ways to be a more attentive lover.	5	nthused	Fun and good advice
2016-04-09 00:59:05	Emily is open, funny, kind, and really cares! She actually answers emails and her funny banter with Anderson is so funny :) listen if you have a sense of humor and anything to learn :)	5	caseyjayner	So funny and so informative

2016-04-06 23:14:04	Emily has a great voice that just made for radio and podcasting. I love her co host Anderson and menace who also have good input. Emily has gave me solid advice and lots of knowledge on how to please a women and have better relationships. She's truly amazing	5	Deathrayxyz	I love sex with emily
2016-03-30 11:34:59	Found SWE about a year ago and listened to as many past episodes as possible before catching up. In my 40's and married since my early 20's. This podcast helps me be a better partner and has added another level to our sex life. Great co-hosts also.	5	Van074	Great sex and sexual relationship podcast
2016-04-04 19:08:50	"I love a lot of things about this show. But I find myself cringing multiple times per episode when either Anderson or Menace (usually Menace) inevitably says things that are narrow-minded, crude in a not-funny way, or downright misogynistic. I'm not the type to easily offend, but these guys are the worst of the ""morning radio"" types and I prefer my podcasts to be a little more progressive. 

That said, I think Emily gives lots of great advice and she often has really interesting guests. I'll keep listening, but will continue to wonder why Emily puts up with those guys..."	3	LisaTheHam	Would be better with new sidekicks
2016-04-02 22:15:13	I really really tried to like this podcast cuz the subjects were awesome but it lacks so much. They barely touch on the subjects she says her show is about. She's too all over the place. It's 45 min of jibberish and 5 min of actual substance of information.	1	Jess_suckkaaa	I tried
2016-03-30 01:17:43	I love listening to Emily, whether she's dishing sex tips or keeping us up to date with her dating world her podcast is always fun! I always love her guest as well!

I can't go a day without sex with Emily! Has taught me so much. I definitely recommend!	5	laurreeennbabexo	Sex Ed + comedy
2016-03-21 01:02:12	Hey Emily I was on a long road trip listening to podcasts bumped into yours what I like about it is I can usually predict what the therapist will say or the problem solver but you're funny I couldn't tell what you're going to say next and it was very educational as well. It's good for me I feel like I only know man I was kind of raised by the wolves listening to women talk and smart women it's refreshing and it's fun and I think it'll help me have another perspective maybe I'll get along with women better	5	Soggythesurfclown	Funny Smart
2016-03-20 18:14:01	I thought I knew enough and then I found this podcast Sex With Emily - whom I heard about on Loveline. Emily is like all of us, trying to find ways to have a fantastic and fulfilling love life - but she's going out there and doing something about it and empowering us to follow suit. My husband is appreciative too / as things are heating up. Thank you so much Emily for doing what you do! And Menace, talk more on a male's point of view - Anderson is quickly surpassing you on the sharing LOL Back on topic - Emily, love your show! Don't ever stop podcasting :)	5	jakes_girl	Sex With Emily - YOU NEED THIS!

2016-03-01 07:24:35	I love Sex With Emily, I have learned so many things about sex by listening to this podcast. My sex life has improved a lot! Emily has taught me to ask for what I want and get more orgasms. She is amazing! Thanks for everything you do Emily!	5	Snhanks	Fabulous
2016-03-11 00:35:49	Horrible	1	April wallimulffer	Bad
2016-03-10 04:04:14	Anderson can't stop talking. It's horrible. I'm sure he's a wonderful person but he's podcast AIDS. stop talking over the host! Let her get a couple thoughts out before you chime in or repeat what she just said. Every time Emily takes a breath, you make sounds. it's grating.	3	TokiWarTruth	Ditch em
2016-03-09 14:09:45	I'd rather sit through AM/FM commercials!	1	HoustonPerez	Terrible!
2016-02-28 03:33:13	I listen to every episode every week and have benefited from her advice immensely! I love the camaraderie between everyone on the show. Keep up the good work!	5	zrh1989	A+++++
2016-02-25 21:52:14	I've always listened to Emily on Love Line, and now I'm constantly listening to this podcast. Her insight is great and the conversations between her and Menace are great! Love the honesty	5	Cmfabelo	Love love love
2016-02-26 20:05:20	At first it was interest but now that I catch up with the podcast  couldn't listen to no more.She is not really a doctor. She a fake please don't waste your time.	1	Titi1988tito420	Not enough information
2016-02-24 20:46:57	I listen on my way home from work. Love the personalities all mixed together.	5	Meeshkafish	Love this podcast
2016-02-19 04:52:57	I want to love SWE but Emily & Menace talk way to much about themselves. Some episodes are very good. I don't like menace, I wish Emily give he the boot off the show. I love listening to Emily, she's awesome. Just wish she talk about more of relationships & advice, it takes about hour get to relationships & advice	5	Oh how	I hate Menace!!!!
2016-02-11 01:24:46	Emily makes me lol in every podcast. The only podcast I listen to on a regular basis.	5	Buttluv26	LOVE Emily
2016-02-12 16:30:10	I had such high hopes for this podcast. However after a few  episodes I realized the show is just ramblings sprinkled with sex toy ads. It's just not worth the time to listen	1	Fweem1970	Rambling see toy ad
2016-02-09 22:21:46	Love it!!! Listen to it everyday!	5	BarbieJCo	Great show!
2016-02-01 01:19:18	Been a listener for a while and Emily and the crew do a great job during these shows!	5	Topstv	Great listen!
2016-02-02 04:13:31	Its basically a ad machine	1	Darkness in dread	Very bad
2016-01-03 06:19:13	You have to slow down so your words are not slurred	2	non espanol	Slow down
2016-01-25 01:34:46	I really did give this podcast a chance, however any sort of real advice is over shadowed by the hosts being so self absorbed. The theme music itself is all about hot hot Emily is, and little about actual advice.	1	Happy go lucky	Self absorbed
2016-01-15 21:43:13	Just truly awful.	1	bmwilly	Painfully bad
2016-01-15 20:06:35	"This is an inexperienced girl who gives advice from ideals she has not real life experience. It's a lot of "" just talk to your partner "" not how to talk to them. It's just some kid (who seems to have just discovered sex 2 years ago and now considers herself an expert) with the means to make a podcast. Zero credibility. Skip this."	1	5footer	Inexperienced
2015-09-30 10:49:20	Love the honest advice and tips. Emily is great at debunking myths and sharing stats. She's great at recommending products and really makes sex fun.	4	Kristen in PA	Emily is adorable and informative
2015-11-27 00:29:40	Too much talking about personal gossip. Topics are good just aren't focused on the whole podcast.. Menace is annoying.	1	2433,(::,ff	podcast has potential but
2015-11-24 07:23:13	The show doesn't ever really cover anything new. You won't really learn anything that you can't pick up from Cosmo. If you're a heterosexual, vanilla twenty something this show is probably for you...but again...don't expect anything mind blowing. Also Menace is horrible. I find myself cringing at everything he says and his constant need to brag about everything he's doing. Anderson does better as a co-host but still doesn't offer up the sex positive and inclusive attitude many may be looking for.	2	Haight&Ashbury	Meh
2015-11-17 00:22:00	I feel like I am learning so much! I wish I had discovered this sooner!	5	Krazyauntjoe	Addicted
2015-11-10 13:08:22	Found the show because I'm a fan of menace. Show was good but Emily doesn't talk much about sex. It's just all sponsers and stories of her life. We are tuning in for info not life stories	1	Woody show fan	Entertaining and informative
2015-11-06 06:43:07	Re-enforces bad stereotypes in regards to gender and is just people talking without structure.	1	Adamantium3	Very disorganized and sexually unhealthy
2015-10-27 00:54:57	Emily has such an engaging personality and the enthusiasm and joy she has for her work is infectious. All of her guests as well as her two man rotation of Menace and Anderson add very different, but wonderful insight from the male perspective. Keep up the great work!	5	Erik Gaines	Advice and tips with spunk
2015-10-19 14:07:19	"A self serving bore-fest. An uninformed, egotistical  host. A sidekick that is unengaged and sounds like he is checking his phone while recording the show. 
Nothing says L.A. bubble, like this show."	1	BuncoKelly	In a word... Vapid.
2015-10-15 19:05:55	I love Emily, but I really cannot listen to the podcast when Anderson is on with her.  He makes annoying, narrow minded comments that are irrelevant and take away from Emily's content.  I feel like the purpose of this show is to encourage people to have an open mind and a positive attitude in the realm of sex and relationships, but Anderson is so negative with his comments that are often times insulting and discouraging.  I want to listen to Sex with Emily, not Ignorance with Anderson.	3	jdinner	Take Anderson off the Show!
2015-10-13 22:49:50	Emily is so much fun to listen to. She and Menace take you on a little adventure during every show. I'm totally hooked and sometimes get impaitent waiting for the next episode to appear on iTunes. Just want to show some love from the Bluegrass state!!! Your awesome!	5	Jessb524	So Much Fun
2015-10-11 20:19:02	Love the information. Love the advice. Sometimes at the beginning of the show, the hosts spend a lot of time catching up on their personal lives. I don't listen to a sex advice column for that. But I like that the hosts are friends. It helps create an atmosphere of fun and comfort.	5	Coconut jack o lantern	Yay, Emily!
2015-10-05 00:45:45	I've been listening to this podcast for about a month now. I love it!! Good advice. Good banter. The hosts treat the issues with intelligence and facts, not BS and stories!	5	SlackerNick	Love this show!!
2015-10-02 23:11:47	Thank you Emily & Menace!! My husband and I both listen to your podcasts.  They are very informational, and fun.  We are in our mid 50's and since we started to listen to your shows our sex life is more spicy, planned and FUN....we've been able to explore more with sex toys, etc since learning tipsbabout different types/where to get/how to use.  Thank you so much for everything you do!	5	Laurigyd	Love your show!!
2015-10-01 17:44:48	Sex with Emily is a great show. Always great advice and Emily is very likable. Great show guys!😊	5	B HURTARTE	👍🏼

2015-09-28 20:18:42	I love the show.  It has some of the podcast info available.	5	Suunsu	Great show and great info.
2015-09-28 18:44:36	I am addicted to this show! It's super fun to listen to, and I've had fun sharing what I hear with my fiancé. Emily recommends some really great products, and always answers viewer questions in a very genuine way. I will continue to be a loyal listener.	5	CourtneyWebb	Fun and informative!
2015-09-23 22:51:02	One of my favorite pod casts, love it when Lynette is the co-host - you two are great together!	5	Lita A*3377	Love it! Keep up the good work!
2015-09-07 21:28:49	Excellent	4	Amariak	Sex with emily
2015-09-17 18:15:15	"Listened to an episode because a friend was a featured guest, and my friend was by far the most knowledgeable person about anything sex-related. I've listened to a few dozen more episodes, and it didn't get any better. With as long as Emily has been doing this, you'd think she'd not have to read through (bumble through) a pre-prepared script about anal sex or whatever the topic of the week is. She's much easier to listen to when she speaks off the cuff, but even then her knowledge of sex, kink, and gender/sexual orientation politics is really sub-par.

Her co-hosts are even worse. Menace is an inarticulate brainless dullard, doesn't understand women (or humans, really) at all, and usually sounds like he's either high or playing with his phone, or both. Anderson is homophobic, transphobic, a huge slut-shamer, mostly disgusted by kinks of any kind, and serves no purpose other than self-promotion. When Madison comes out of the booth and goes on mic, that's about the only time something smart comes out of the mouth of someone who works for the show.

There is no greater example of Los Angeles shallowness than this podcast."	1	punkassjim	Terrible, shallow, not helpful
2015-09-03 05:40:32	"I love this show! It's realistic, witty, intelligent and all with a touch of class.
It helps me survive my work day by making me laugh, think, learn and fantasize!
Only wish the podcast had a video feed on iTunes but I still love ya! Xoxo Cassandra"	4	CMP1008	Helps me get through my work day!
2015-09-04 14:27:14	I listen to a number of podcasts on a variety of subjects. This is one I go to as soon as new episodes are released.	5	wgajr1	One of my favorites
2015-09-03 17:30:21	I never learn anything new. You guys always promise amazing subjects but under deliver. It's painful to listen to you talk about your sex toys over and over. Keep your personal life stories to 5 mins or less not 3/4ths of the episode I miss sex nerd Sandra.	1	Tatotot77	Meh
2015-08-25 23:19:50	Just started listening to the podcast and I am obsessed!	4	IphoneAllTheWay	New listener
2015-08-26 12:29:35	"Was when Emily did a show on BDSM and said, as a disclaimer at the beginning of her podcast that she was going to exclusively use feminine pronouns when referring to submissives because, ""it's just easier.""  In an effort to be a sex positive podcast as she claims, she did a huge disservice in that statement alone.  All-in-all, it seems like it's mostly just a commercial about her favorite toys, and she is very pushy about it.  This is not a podcast for sex-positive people, it is a podcast for vanilla, heteronormative people that want to think they are sex-positive."	1	rhgold94	What Set Me Off...
2015-08-25 20:32:22	This is a great sex positive podcast to listen to. Two thumbs up! FYI Married sex episode cuts off at 20 minutes.	5	The502entourage	Great podcast

2015-08-11 21:25:53	I love listening to Sex With Emily. Whether it's Menace or Anderson joining in, they're both funny and add to the different viewpoints of a man's perceptive. I laugh and learn from these podcasts and I look forward to them every day (I have a lot of catching up to do). Thanks for the entertainment and the education! I am a 30 year old female.	5	Moronez85	Entertaining and informative
2015-08-16 01:14:10	I love when Emily guest hosts on Loveline but I just can't handle this podcast. I've been a subscriber for a couple months and even listened to older episodes, so I think it's fair to say that I've given it a fair shot. This show is about 50% sales pitch, 30% talking about what they did last week, and 20% actual content. Pretty disappointing that she really only answers two questions per episode. If you want coupon codes for vibrators, this is the place to get it.	2	Its_gigi	I really tried!
2015-07-31 15:52:35	I'm a big Dan Savage fan and I've been looking for similar podcasts that where as enjoyable only to stumble upon Sex with Emily. I'm sure glad I did! Love the show, adore her cute little squeaky girl voice and adore her!	5	rjayne1	Love this Lady

2015-07-18 18:38:05	Stumbled upon this recently and can't believe I'm SO late to the party on this one. A fun listen loaded with great advice.	5	Nanseadee	Love!
2015-06-16 10:58:25	"You can't beat Emily's honesty, she obviously loves what she does.
I never listen to more than one episode at a time as it is fluffy but if you don't take it too seriously it's great and if you learn something new to try, bonus.
If you want more serious sex podcasts try ""Why Are People Into That"" or ""Sex Out Loud"".
Thanks Emily."	4	Srdr946	Good Honest Fun
2015-07-15 11:34:41	Emily is so cute and has so much energy! She makes sex not taboo and helps people with all types of sexual issues. She reiterates communication is the key in relationships and is also key with sex. Say yes and enjoy! Love listening to Emily!	5	hulagirlal	So cute and fun to listen to
2015-07-14 23:50:08	I love listening to this show. Emily has helped me tremendously and I can't thank her enough. The workshops she gives at Hustler Hollywood are a lot of fun and really informative plus who doesn't love free champagne?! Keep up the good work Em and the team 💪🏻	5	AprylDeadly	Emily is AMAZING
2015-07-14 03:51:51	So funny but so informative.	5	Mc8086	Great advice!
2015-07-14 02:35:17	Emily tells it straight which I love.  She helps me tap into areas that I formerly was too shamed to think about.  Love her!	5	LEH820	Listen for a good time!
2015-07-05 21:38:30	"This show is an excellent addition to my podcast lineup. Im more of a podcast listener than a traditional radio listener. Sex with Emily is a great podcast for information, entertainment & general tips & tricks for the everyday person. 
Her approach to many complex topics makes this podcast great for any listening audience. I just introduced this podcast to my wife and she enjoyed it. Emily also provides personal insight & advice to her listeners who email her questions that can be answered on the show. 
Her show airs twice a week, & I look forward to each episode. This isn’t the podcast that is meant as a sexual stimulant its more of a listen & apply approach to sex. 
If you’re looking for a great entertaining podcasts, Sex with Emily is a must-add to your lineup!"	5	FatalRainz	One of my Go-To Podcast!
2015-07-05 02:43:40	"We all have career choices to make and Dr. Emily Morse's A^2 education set her on the road to Documentary Filmmaker (And, See How They Run, is among the best documentaries of a big campaign ever made) - but, Emily decided to take another path--completing her Ph.D. In human sexuality and launched her public campaign to bring us all up to date on human sexuality. 

The show is fun, approachable, thorough, and Emily and her guests have a great time while  addressing critical issues of common sexuality, sexual dysfunction, and sexual FUN!  

Great show. It's clear that a huge amount of work goes into these podcasts and I'm catching up on the whole back catalogue!"	5	grolaw	Incredibly well done - thorough without overly clinical
2015-07-03 20:24:07	Great show. Highly entertaining and informative! Fab personalities!	5	MarPio	Great!

Your show gives me lots of ideas and entertainment to add to my love life.

2015-06-18 14:08:55	She has taught me so much about sex and relationships. I love menace he so funny.	5	live1life	I love this show
2015-06-17 22:39:13	I wanted to like this especially since Menace from the Woody Show promoted it on the show, but it lacks something. A lot of unnecessary banter in the beginning. Some episodes are more interesting than others.	2	Karighalli	Meh... Just okay
2015-06-17 19:44:47	I truly enjoy listening. It has given me lots of great ideas to try with my wife and discuss new things with her.  I am so thankful for Emily!	5	rjsmith608	So Thankful For Emily

2015-06-14 20:10:50	Found this podcast about 6 months ago and I'm always looking forward to the new episodes every week! My favorite part of the podcast is the email Q&A. Keep it going!	5	AnnieM0778	Lovin it!
2015-04-15 12:43:37	Like the show a lot, but have to address one issue about ripping clothes.  A lady should let a man no that it's okay for them to rip panties, bra, or shirt, because we don't want to do that to a lady who would get mad and tell us to leave because she wasn't about that.	4	DREAMSCAPE0	Ripping Clothes
2015-05-28 22:39:04	Enjoy Menace and Anderson’s conversations.  I like the show on some of the advice and  sharing “what’s in the news”.	5	33ee2	Great Show!
2015-05-06 20:44:00	Downloaded 6 episodes,at first it was ok and kept me interested in hopes of catching good info. At the end it's very plain not actually taking about or giving full advice on sex. It's all about the toys, toys and more toys.moving on	2	Flipeed68	I tried it...
2015-05-06 11:41:00	I love Emily, she gives great advice but it's true, it is a little repetitive BUT it's a sex podcast, there are only so many ways you can talk about humping and making out. I love the advice and tips she gives and I love her even more on Loveline. One thing I hate is Menace. Why is he even on the show? He's a complete moron who knows nothing about sex or relationships and his opinions always make my eyes roll to the back of my head. GET RID OF HIM, make him the full time behind the scenes only guy or something. I also love when Anderson is on ! He has some insightful male perspective on the topics.	3	Theeone-who-knocks	Great- get rid of Menace now
2015-04-28 21:49:24	I love this podcast and listening to Emily.  I just think she should cut back on the energy drinks a little before show time.  She is such a spaz.	5	avd1990	Great Show
2015-04-22 04:34:40	"I love the show and wish I could have more Sex with Emily . I love her take on sex & relationships. I am a fairly new listener but I am getting caught up on all the past podcasts & so far this is my favorite show to listen to. Keep up the good work Emily & I am trying to apply your phrase ""communication is lubricantion"" to my marriage."	5	TinkHerbal	I love Sex
2015-04-21 22:26:03	"I found Sex With Emily in 2012 when looking for something to listen to while working in Washington State, and I quickly fell in love with the show. I later got married in 2013 and got my hubby addicted to the show as well! Now we live in Southern California and I hope that one day we will be able to meet Emily in San Fran! She's opened our eyes to so many new experiences and opionions and I wouldn't change her show for the world. Hope someday you see this Emily Morse.

2015-02-05 06:33:01	Less ads, more sex. Emily is smoking hot and so is her voice, she just talks really fast..	4	tacobellrules	Funny, witty, informative
2015-04-13 20:45:25	My wife and I both listen regularly, and we're always picking up something new! It's not just sex tips, but personal hygiene and interesting things going on in the world! I recommed it to so many people, and it has not even come close to getting old and tired for us!	5	JkTurners	It's Our Go To
2015-03-16 17:58:46	Does she ever stop talking about herself long enough to actually have sex?	1	suclaire	Awful
2015-03-10 05:46:33	I cannot believe how grandiose sex-negative and judgmental this show has become. Emily is too preoccupied with expanding her brand at all cost. For a better experience listen to Sex Nerd Sandra. Emily does sex podcasts completely wrong.	1	GA6HHHHHHH!	Doctorate in human sexuality does not make one sex positive
2015-02-20 04:59:42	I tried so hard to listen and was annoyed the entire time  the guy with you on your show kills it for me, he is not smart or witty enough about sex to be on your pod cast you talk about you advertisements and emails then you do about sex, you lost another pod caster, read your reviews	1	Funny.a.f	So Dissapointed
2015-02-19 02:01:29	Too many adverts for toys. Also, Menace is a disaster and sounds like Carell from 40 Year Old Virginia. He seems to know next to nothing about all things sex. Get the guy from Film Vault on more, Anderson, I think...please! But, all in all, a great podcast!	3	JMH85JMH	Good, but could be great.
2015-02-15 05:18:24	Just found out about this podcast though the chain of podcasters interviewing podcasters! The Chalene Show-> Art of Charm -> Sex with Emily! Love all this awesome sexy info!	5	Great Photo App	Catching up!
2015-02-14 22:15:40	I used to enjoy this show. Emily is smart and witty, but she unfortunately is actually totally self-centered and conceited. She has this friend on the show, a total idiot - Menas who is the most narrow minded, narcissistic dimwit with the sexual maturity of a bookend. He  loves to talk about himself and laugh at the sexuality of others. Emily, you really need to ditch this half-wit idiot and stick to having mature, sexually evolved guests on your show.	1	Wild sandy	Ugh!
2015-01-03 01:25:24	My wife and I have been married for 20 years. During this time we've had dry spells but are having the best sex ever! We love revisiting what makes us crave sex. The show is both fun and informative.	4	rokanator	Great show
2015-01-26 20:16:00	Honestly I've been listening to this show for a year now and it hasn't gotten any better. I really enjoy listening to andersons perspective but emily is so superficial. She is so self absorbed and needs a man who will actually stay with her. It used to be a much better show. Going down from here. Sorry	2	Laureenu	Not sure anymore
2015-01-23 18:52:30	One of the best things I ever gotten on a first date! I dated a guy that lived Emily, so I said I would check her out. He is long gone, but Emily is still around! She is funny and educational all at the same time! Love her, Anderson, Menace and the interns!	5	Xandra311	One of my favorite podcast!
2015-01-10 05:13:54	After listening to Emily hock everything she possibly can(she wasn't done, she concluded with more selling!) first she says she had one or two threesomes, then later on she confesses to more(honesty issues), she was completely reading off a list, with the worst advice you can possibly give! She didn't even discuss the #1 issue in a threesome which is protection or not, how to go about discussing that. Then she goes on to say men shouldn't try pleasing both women at the same time! Jesus woman what kind of porn do you watch?? This show is all hype, her toolbag co host epitomizes toolbaggery. Complete waste of time! Out of an hour I would say 55min was boring back and forth with her co host about you guessed it, promoting her different endeavors, alittle over five min I would guess actually dealt with threesomes. Sheesh!	1	rnsone	Threesome Episode
2014-12-31 13:22:36	I love that there is finally an amazing podcast about real sex questions! I'm so happy I heard you on For Crying Out Loud- you are now one of my favorite podcasts!	5	JgedCLE	Yes!
2014-10-13 18:46:56	We need more podcasts like this. I'm 26 now and I grew up on Dr. Drew, it's nice to see a female voice in this game. I look forward to the regular podcast, her tips are practical and useful. I love how many podcasts she has. I only gave it four stars because I would love it if Emily could not talk over her guests, sometimes it's distracting. I get lost in who the interview or session is about - Emily or the guest? I'd also like her to speak more clearly rather than speaking so quickly she trips over her own words. Whether it's promotions or conversations, almost every episode includes her eating her own words. I think Emily has great things to say, I want to hear them!	4	CurlyLocd	A female leading interesting conversations about sex
2014-12-24 06:25:48	Emily is my girl! I love the great information she provides, and the flow of her shows. Keep doing what you doing girl. I know this made you smile :) happy holidays! Much LOVE <3	5	Papicruzer	I Love Em
2014-12-18 18:57:00	I listened to the premature ejaculation episode and it turned out to be an infomercial for numbing spray. Shallow garbage.	1	Cascadia73	Terrible
2014-12-17 00:52:49	Your show rocks I love how you put it all out there	5	JJbroadway	Best show ever
2014-12-16 18:47:29	I love the show! But there is one thing I cannot stand!!! I understand your mouth may get dry but I hate the sound everyone makes when they drink water! It grosses me out its so loud and it happens every episode 😑	3	Deeeeveeeee144400000999	Love
2014-12-15 07:54:39	I completely found this podcast by accident  after I listened to every episode of the hip hop podcast I was hooked on. I'm 24 from LI/NY and I am definitely learning a lot about sex love and relationships. I have learned new tricks for the bed, learned how to handle certain situations with females and how to weed out the bad women who want me from the good. I wish I found this podcast years ago but better late than never right?	5	Skitt4382	Love it
2014-12-13 01:57:21	Absolutely love this podcast! Listen to it every week. Also love Emily, she's adorable and so funny.	5	Ren123f123	sex with emily
2014-12-12 21:20:02	Some of the information and guests are interesting and informative But they talk nonsense for the first 20 mins of the show and don't even get to the main topic until right at the end. So most of the show is the two hosts talking to each other about nothing.  Like listening in on two teen hipsters small talk to each other. It's annoying.  If I wanted to listen in on people talking I would take my earbuds out and eves drop on the hipsters on the other side of the bus.  Make the show shorter and just talk about the main topic and not all this other nonsense that nobody cares about.	1	Hauntedmac2	Good info but not very good show
2014-12-09 02:32:10	Emily belongs on the Howard Stern show. Her target audience is insecure adolescent boys who will think she's hot, overlook her own insecurity, and have yet to touch a boob. And even they would be better served by finding another podcast. It's not that there's nothing useful here, it's that it's at such a ridiculously basic level and couched so thoroughly in Emily's desperate need for approval that it's irritating. There are many much better options -- don't waste your time here.	2	terminalfatigue	As bad as drivetime radio
2014-12-07 07:09:34	I began listening earlier this year and am a huge fan and never miss an episode! Great with Anderson and menace you Emily have given great advice and opened my eyes to new things! A must hear show for everyone!!	5	Dammitman	Incredible show!!
2014-12-05 15:06:58	If you want to improve or begin your sex life Emily has great information and motivation for you! Please understand she also helps people who are very different from you so don't listen if you don't accept other people's desires and choices.	5	Jason, California	Improve Your Sex Life

2014-10-23 03:09:08	Emily has an unbridled enthusiasm for sex, from talking about it, to sharing details and tips with guests and the on-air cohorts, yet the podcast is more sales pitch than sex advise, what with the constant pitching of products. Add in the lugubrious pre-subject banter and it’s a healthy investment of your time just to get to the topic which, often, is not detailed or anything not found elsewhere.	2	Guerrillascribe	Plenty of Potential Yet It’s Premature
2014-09-30 15:31:45	"Emily offers tons of useful information in a way that balances her nerdiness, sense of humor, and great interviewing skills. 

My only critique of the show is that male guests are often really creepy and misogynistic. Not all the men, but many of them just regurgitate tired stereotypes and ideas about what women want and what men should be like. To me, that gets in the way of Emily’s message about making knowledge about sex comfortable and accessible. I commend Emily for putting up with them."	5	Julitton	LOVE THIS PODCAST!
2014-09-21 00:39:37	Great topics and excellent advice.  I learn something every time I listen.	5	Regalzr7	You should love Emily

2014-09-17 23:42:38	First heard you on the Brody Jenner podcast and fell in love!!! I immediately went and subscribe to your podcast, your voice was the first thing that drew me to you, I just loved the sound of it. Anyways I learn something new every week and look forward to the next show, and you've made me realize how little my 27 year old self actually knows about sex, toys, health and the usage of never having to much lube.!.! I've even got my husband and a few friends to listen. So keep up the good work. Love always Amanda	5	Brandon Innerst	Amazing
2014-09-03 18:25:14	I'm a new listener but I can't stop listening to her great energy useful information and sexy voice	5	Sexpositive2000	Can't stop listening

2014-08-23 16:53:07	I Love this podcast. I like listening to radio talk shows & they are usually on in the am. So it's great to be able to get into my car day or night and listen to Emily talk about different topics and products.	5	VA Game Fun	Happy Listener 😊
2014-08-21 21:19:21	I have been a listener from her first debut on itunes. Emily and Menace are great together and have provided lots of information about human sexuality. It has helped me in my personal sex life and communications.	4	shouser1955	Long listener
2014-08-21 22:57:40	Ive been listening for a long time and love the show. I have no idea where some of the bad reviews come from(competition??) but they are WRONG. Always informative and educational. Ive learned a ton from you Emily! Keep up the great work! Thank You!!	5	dtsoll	Love the show Em!!
2014-08-19 23:07:48	Always energetic and fun, the podcast flows well (although some people will be put off by Emily's rapid fire speech patterns).Only reason that this doesn't get a five-star from me is that the subjects are fairly hit-and-miss in my interest areas. Nonetheless, I recognize a good, fun podcast when I hear it, and I do subscribe.	4	Laughing Vergil	Pretty dang good
2014-08-19 06:12:18	Sometimes a bit corny, but great advice from a responsible expert is always welcome.	5	andy flyy	great host, great advice
2014-08-19 03:26:09	Love the podcast. So many great topics!	5	jennifer alaniz	Great podcast
2014-08-18 20:23:38	I started off listening to this show, not really knowing what to expect. I love sex talk and hearing tips. I did not expect to fall in love with Emily and every person she speaks to. Yes, she speaks fast- but I feel like her conversations go so smoothly. Almost like who ever she speaks to is her best friend. I have listened to every episode, and added Emily as a favorite on my podcasts. I love learning new things and hearing tips on new toys. I have not disliked an episode yet! If you enjoy sex talk, different perspectives on sex, and learning about toys- listen to this show!! You will fall in love with Emily quickly!	5	Lkcess	I love Emily
2014-08-16 22:40:33	I’ve always enjoyed this show because of Emily’s credible advice and fun demeanor.  I’ll stay a fan for a while, especially as she begins to expand into other tangential topics.	5	FairPlay424	Credible advice
2014-08-15 01:47:30	This is a great sex and relationship podcast! Emily has amazing guests, great co-hosts, and she is awesome! This is the only sex and relationship podcast you'll need! This podcast has turned me on to many amazing things!! Emily's super hot too, but that doesn't matter, right!! You should subscribe to this podcast and then subscribe to her newsletter. It's worth it!!	5	Jared76	Stop HERE!
2014-08-13 23:09:52	Love this podcast. Not only does it have me laughing, it is also extremely informative. Keep these episodes coming.	5	Shifel88	Funny and helpful!!
2014-08-13 18:51:32	"Emily your podcast is so entertaining! I commute to work over an hour at times. Until I figured out what podcast were I hated the drive, now I hate getting out of my car if I haven't finished listening to the episode. Emily's hyper energy is addicting! She's so grounded as a person and really appreciate her honesty all around. She cracks me up every-time and I find myself looking for the like button on random quotes she will say during the episodes. If I lived closer id totally want to be her friend! Menace is great as well, never afraid to put Emily in her place and call her out on anything. One of my favorite episodes was when Emily kept yelling at him. They keep it real and that's why I'm so entertained constantly! I'm a fan of Emily's products. I bought her candle and absolutely love it. The texture is perfect for massaging and the scent is almost hypnotic. It's like Emily came in the bedroom and put a spell on you for amazing sex! After using it one night I walked by it and the smell of it instantly turned me on! Lol I'm serious I had to stop and think what was going on! I've always been a sexual person but listening and learning through Sex with Emily has brought me to a better understanding of human sexual needs and desires. Emily keep up your fabulous work! We need more women in the world like you! And my boyfriend thanks you for always coming home horny after listening. Menace keep her on her toes because all cool chicks need a guy to make them laugh at themselves. 
     Much Love,

2014-08-10 17:34:56	You asked and you shell receive. A review.  A great way to pass the time while learning about sex and relationship from Emily's and the guest experience. All who work on the show has great interactions and chemistry .especially I love your inters and assistants	4	chuny6	you're great and you it,
2014-08-12 15:17:43	I've been listening to Sex with Emily ever since I got a desk-bound job and sought out listening to interesting podcasts. Emily has such a bubbly and likable personality, with the credibility of being a professional sex-pert! There is a lot of sex information out there and I know that the information I get from Emily and her guests is always backed by a professional. I've learned so much personally from her advice and have carried it over to my own relationship. I feel more open and receptive to concepts I've once been uncomfortable with - all thanks to Emily! Keep up the good work and I look forward to all your fun and informative podcasts!	5	lmc-b	Thumbs Up!
2014-08-12 03:58:02	So this is a great show, Emily is hilarious and provides a ton of information that has made me significantly better in bed. I am starting to become a sex need myself and I can't get enough info. I very seriously recommend this podcast, it's amazinggggg!	5	Snosh88	Hilarious and full of need to know info for guys
2014-08-11 23:54:35	"Emily is  a class act. She makes everyone feel so comfortable. I've been listening for about three months . Sex can be hard to talk about but she makes it easy.

Keep it up"	5	Byejejjdj	Peri menopausal woman loves listening
2014-08-10 14:46:30	I listen on the train while making the commute to DC every day and it's always a treat to hear Emily and her guests address real world problems that real people have.  I bought the massage candle and the down under comfort, and my wife and I share both items and thoroughly enjoy the comfort and pleasure that follow.  Keep it up and I'll keep listening.	5	DC-commuter	Great info, in a fun format
2014-08-09 19:30:56	Ok just kidding! Em is great one of my favorite podcasts of all time. First I listen to Adam Carolla then Emily!	5	Rice Bowl	Emily doesn’t talk fast enough….
2014-08-09 11:09:04	I love this show. The tips and advice Emily provides are informative and useful. She presents a safe forum where everyone can feel comfortable talking about their wants and needs. The discussions are conversational and not formal or clinical. And she inserts humor when it is appropriate. To top it all off... Emily is super-hot. This show is perfect.	5	Brnxrul	Great Show
2014-08-02 02:52:04	"Many of us are just plain tired of hiding our concerns about our sexuality. How refreshing it is to find a host who will really ""go there"" with us and talk about the stuff on our mind. She is a kind, compassionate educator who assures us that we are all normal and are capable of enjoying pleasure on our own terms. Saftey and enjoyment are always her top priorities! Thank you Emily!"	5	cdunc	Squeaky [Clean?] Fun!!!!

2014-07-09 02:30:07	I’d equate Emily to the female Howard Stern (who I also love).  She isn’t bashful talking about sex, and it’s a fun listen.	5	HiThisIsCourtney	More Than Sex

2014-03-24 16:54:11	"I'm writing this review for adults looking for honest, sex positive talk.

Who is this podcast for?She's an adult. She talks about adult things, but I couldn't tell if she was talking to teenagers or not by the tone of her voice. I'm not sure who she's trying to relate to but I was really turned off because it reminded me of the youth-obsessed nature of our culture where people, especially women, refuse to grow up. Is this what attracts men to women? Acting like a little girl? 

The episode I was listening to started with a news item about Justin Beiber. He's not even of a legal drinking age and I'm supposed to care about what's happening in a teenager's sex life?

Later she launched into an unspecific tirade about being treated right by one's boyfriend without really addressing what that actually meant. It seemed like one of those ""positive platitudes"" that float around in the diaspora these days. You can file it with ""manifest it"" and ""you can be anything you dream"".  

If you're an adult looking for realness, look elsewhere. If you're a celebrity obsessed teenager on the cusp of adulthood who needs a primer on adult relationships, you should look elsewhere too. The subject matter is not really for teens.  Lastly, if you're a 20 something trying to navigate the adult landscape, look elsewhere. This woman is liable to make you think being a teenager is a permanent affliction."	1	ayotte girl	Who is this podcast for?
2013-11-07 01:01:11	I've been listing for  couple of years. Emily is very informative and improve my sex life, the tips have help with my partner, who now is my wife thanks Emily.	5	Ndotym13	informative
2014-03-20 14:19:34	I tried 5 episodes from over the run. Unfortunately, Emily  doesn't have any kind of focus with respect to her topics, much less a coherent and mature point of view. Her advice is no more developed than a list of sex tips from a twenty year old issue of Cosmopolitan, and her cohost Menace is nothing less than a complete moron. Sex Nerd Sandra, Savage Love, and Tristan Taoromino's Sex Out Loud are all much, much better options.	1	SirWadie	Huge disappointment
2014-03-07 20:10:52	Listened for 6mo straight to give it a chance.. I've had enough.	1	89Butters	Clucking Hen
2014-02-16 15:41:55	One big advertisement.  She can say what she wants, she's doing this for the money.  Much better podcasts out there that have content and aren't trying to get you to buy products	1	candrfisherman	ONE BIG ADVERTISEMENT!  PASS!!!
2014-02-12 23:21:42	Great guests that come on the show, but so sick and tired of Emily trying to sell you products in between conversations. Totally doesn't flow with the show. This happens multiple times throughout the podcast and has been getting worse	1	Jammin01	Use to be good....
2014-01-10 21:41:15	Cannot listen to podcast at all because Emily mumbles sooo bad. And how is she an expert on sex? Everything I've heard from her is very common sense and nothing new or helpful. Talk more clear and maybe I will try again.	1	GFGirl47	Ugh podcast one why??
2013-12-31 00:24:52	Obviously they pay the bills because she's peddling their products every 5 minutes.  She's a spokesperson for them and it feels so gross to listen to.  Most shows, if they advertize at all, do it at the beginning or at the end.  It's so swarmy how they slide these products into every conversation.  So gross!!	1	Somewherenorth	nothing more than PR and product placement for an obsure sex toy shop in San Francisco
2013-12-10 16:34:17	Sometimes the show can be entertaining. But mostly its just Emily finding ways to sell her products or sell sponsors.  I get it..you need to make money off doing this. But it gets to the point where your so off topic that I realize I learned nothing.  Plus at this point her advice is all the same.  I would seek out a different sex related podcast than this one.	2	thrillhouse1979	Good in SMALL Does
2013-12-02 21:43:59	Good audio clarity and great intro song, but she wastes a lot of time chit chatting and might not get to the titled topic until the last 5 minutes. Also a lot of product placement.	2	stpfdstrs	Could be better
2013-11-20 00:11:25	"I just listened to the most recent episode titled ""Threesomes"".  As a the male part of a committed relationship that has had threesomes I can say that her advice was way off the mark.  Either we are the outlier minority, or more likely, she is totally wrong.  Emily (and Menace) said ""the #1 rule is that a threesome must be her idea""  - REALLY? That is your number 1 rule?  That is sexist and closed-minded.  Threesomes and swinger parties were my idea and my GF has enjoyed greatly as have I.  She also says ""there is no way to delve into it without an argument (unless its her idea)""  Wow.  What kind of relationships does Emily have?  No matter what the subject is, two mature adults in love should be able to converse, ""delve"" even without an argument.  I'm not saying we never argue, but I'm saying it isn't because of the topic that we argue, it is all about communication/relationship skills.  You would think a ""relationship expert"" would know that.  Menace's advice, ""don't ever let your woman go on vacation by herself"" which Emily then agreed with and said she had ""gotten in to trouble"" traveling by herself in the past.  Wow.  That is not only anti-feminist and sexist, it completely discounts that two people who care for each other might just be able to not cheat on each other even when on vacation.  I did not hear any good advice in this podcast.  Emily also suggested checking Craigslist and then said, ""but DON'T hire anyone from Craigslist"".  Again, I have met highly professional sex workers who advertise and CL and I would hate to think someone as sexist and ignorant as Emily appears would cost those pros business.  I might assume Emily was unaware of the questions in advance.  She did plug her products about a dozen times though and said ""I'm ready to start making some real money so buy my products please"".  Yeesh."	1	The_D_19	Threesome episode very sex-negative
2013-11-13 18:45:22	Why can’t they just get to the point? Mindless chatter. Really? You could put the actual information in these podcasts in a ten minute cast and save us the pain of listening to your A.D.D. rantings	1	Trentacosta's	Painful
2013-09-28 21:49:02	I can't get enough Emily! Professional, well done, and very interesting. Highly recommended!	5	JimmyPSHayes	I absolutely LOVE this show!!!
2013-10-26 07:48:37	"I tried listening to a few episodes of this podcast given the vast catalogue of different topics, all of which should've been interesting. Unfortunately, none of them were.

On a typical episode, the hosts chat amongst one another about matters completely unrelated to the topic or sex in general; they seem to forget they're recording a podcast and that they have an audience eagerly awaiting even one mention of the topic. If you're fortunate, the hosts will talk about the topic for thirty seconds. The commentary is vapid; you get the sense that Emily isn't particularly educated(save for about herself and her unrelated anecdotes, of which she has plenty!) or cultured at all. 

'Sex With Emily'  is incessantly banal and boring. The discussion is neither engaging nor entertaining. Emily's voice is obtrusive and obnoxious and is unfortunate enough so as to make her sound really vacuous. 

I absolutely hated this podcast and I am sincerely astounded that it has amassed the following that it has. It was totally awful and I hope my review will dissuade any potential listeners from this insipid waste of time. Don't bother!"	1	Cyxe Frank	vapid, banal, and unbearably obnoxious!
2013-10-19 20:58:52	"I've just recently started listening to this podcast, and I find it not satisfying at all content-wise. In a one hour show, they typically answer 2-3 questions and spend the other 45 minutes just bantering about themselves and plugging various products. The product ""commercials"" are worked into every conversation to the point where it is extremely distracting and after a dozen or so shows, downright annoying. There are many other good sexuality podcasts out there that actually spend time discussing sexuality and not just plugging and self promoting."	1	0myher0	One hour long ad
2013-10-09 00:48:18	Surprisingly dull for such an interesting topic.	2	Frustrated fan--	Kinda dull

2013-09-24 11:38:52	loving listening to emily on love line, great advice, but menace….i can stand that guy, he's useless, find a better co-host.	1	Panzer246	Menace needs to go
2013-09-06 22:23:22	"We tried to give this podcast a chance, but it was torture. Emily comes across as a young valley girl, that loves to hear herself talk. They way she speaks and the manner in which she addresses topics sounds a s though she's self taught and gets her info from women's magazines. She doesn't come across as educated, just willing to talk about taboo topics. I have no idea why Menace is on the show, he offers nothing you can't get from any bro at the gym; he's so shallow and such a cliche. It's just bad radio, regardless of the topic.

She mentioned something about the Kris Jenner show and my wife and I realized if you think the Kardashians are thoughtful and intellectual, you would like this podcast. If you read, (books) or listen to NPR, you'd find this podcast tough to listen to."	1	lapresle	Inane...
2013-08-23 18:21:23	I was really looking forward to listening to this podcast because Emily is on loveline with mike and drew. Sadly, I only enjoined a few podcasts before I felt like pulling my ears out. Emily and mennise spend a good portion of the podcasts talking about things that don't  have anything to do with the subject. It takes them a great deal of time for them to get the point. Emily's voice did it for me. I can't listen it it anymore.	1	Ramirezgal	Disappointment
2013-07-29 01:10:33	Trying to be nice and not give the show 1 star. Very boring, and no information. Half the show is dedicated to sponsors and their products. It may have been good in the beginning, but now just plain awful.	2	D I T	Just plain STINKS
2013-02-25 17:03:41	"This is awesome, just starting to get caught up on the episodes from a while ago.  My only wish is that there was not so much promo for the ""Friends with Benefits"" program.  Other than that, it brings a real, honest and genuine perspective to sexuality and our as well as society's view of what is acceptable and not.  If only more people were this open."	5	Pokeysmom	Awesome
2013-05-30 02:50:55	All about pushing some product	1	Billy Gatestein	Silly
2013-05-14 19:13:15	"Lose the dude. Get to the topic. Stop using the word ""like"". Don't beg for shoes."	2	Ljrossow	Not good
2013-05-07 04:48:14	This episode was an infomercial for a breath strip product. It was pure shameless advertising. It was not a good first episode to start with. I hope this is the exception rather than the rule	2	Nrmrvrk	Ep 20: More Oral
2013-05-02 04:59:46	This podcast has gone from humorous and slightly informative to endless infomercials with Emily's attempt to gain some kind of celebrity status.  Pathetic.	1	lamoka141	infomercial
2013-04-16 14:56:24	Way too many plugs, never on topic. Loose the guy and bring in guests to support your topics.	1	Petescoffeemug	Has Possibilities
2013-04-10 13:39:45	Inane blather. Here's a tip: discuss the topic the show is supposed to be about instead of your boring lives.	1	pt-_-109	Inane
2013-03-25 20:48:25	If you are looking for a mature, sophisticated, and informed conversation about human sexuality, this is not it.  However, if you want to hear two mental midgets blabbering on about celebrities, their own uninteresting lives, and their JV-level understanding of sex, you've come to the right place.	1	Nanapull	Tabloid-Level Show
2013-03-22 15:37:53	I downloaded 2 episodes of this podcast and both were full of plugging products, books, TV shows and TV appearances etc. Also, there is a lot of info about what cities Emily and her co-host are traveling to and whether or not they plan on hooking up while there. Maybe I tried 2 bad episodes but I already wasted enough time on this QVC style podcast.	1	Erode NYC	Commercials & not funny
2012-12-18 03:09:00	I love this show.  It's helped me to be more open to sex and intimacy in my own life, and I listen to it while I'm working.  Plus her recommended products are great.  I placed my first order with Jimmy Jane and can't wait to try them out with my partner.  I love the chemistry between Emily and Menace.  They make for great conversation while teaching us all how to talk about our needs and wants openly, casually, and with levity.	5	Courtneyjo	Great Show!
2013-01-08 16:18:23	I listened to about 3 shows and didn't get any useful information, just boring chatter about how great California is and how shallow the hosts are...	1	Jizzy bear	Really boring
2012-10-09 16:44:23	She's no Dan Savage - she's overly promotional with her sponsors, her co-host is an airhead, and she's not right on all topics, but eh... listen after you've listened to Savage Lovecast	5	Dr. Errol Gluck	No Dan Savage
2012-12-12 21:56:54	I really want to like this show but nothing ever happens constant adds and constant talking about where they are traveling and what they are doing day to day. Where is the sex talk?	1	Ldcnolan	I want
2012-12-06 04:09:01	Maybe I haven't been listening long enough, but so far 8 minutes in an it seems more like an infomercial for sex products. The sponsors definitely get the bang for their buck, but so far all I have learned is she worked for bravo, she is sponsored by multiple products and has a blog... No info pertaining to the subject... Zzz	1	jice0383	Cmon
2012-12-02 18:01:40	Here is a tip for a sex podcast...or any podcast or that matter- talk about the advertised subject matter within 15 minutes of the start of the podcast.  After listening to 10 minutes of basically ads for some bravo show, fast forwarded 5 minutes and still hadn't begun discussing anything relevant.  Waste of time.	1	Rjrjddjdbesj	Disappointing
2012-12-02 04:40:32	So many plugs... wandering conversations about the daily banalities of the host's lives.  Super boring for a sex talk show!	1	burger dawg	unlistenable
2012-10-23 17:10:34	Emily and Menace are like the Seinfeld of the sex podcast.  Incredibly self-absorbed and not really aware of it, prone to make a whole show out of nothing.  It's like when you have those little bottles of liquor on an airplane...	3	RoysterSB	Yadda Yadda
2012-10-22 21:38:08	Who doesn't love talking about sex. I downloaded a show to check it out. The hosts sound like they're 18 - 22. So I can deal with that for a show. BUT this Ph.D candidate espouses the spiritual benefits of crystals!!  Um, let's see the peer reviewed paper on this?  You want people to take you seriously?  I mean if you had a 9th grade education maybe. But you have completed a masters degree. Will your committee accept crystals as therapy?  Give me a break.	2	bubbabrent	Ph.D?
2012-10-15 23:44:30	"Made it through half an episode and then gave up. At that point in time Emily and her buddy still talked about the parties they were planning to go to and I couldn't shake the feeling of ""high school radio station"" .... If you like Kelly Kapoor from The Office, however, you might get a laugh out of this show as Emely's mannerisms are exactly the same."	1	Alexander Von Humboldt	Poor
2012-10-09 07:14:38	"Listening to this podcast hurts my head.  I thought Emily was a blonde bimbo.  She speaks like she is uneducated. Her voice is one that at first sounds ok, then she starts sounding like an annoying teenage girl dying for attention.   Her partner is annoying with his never ending bragging.  When they talk to guests they should be embarrased at the poor sound quality, it makes the show cheaper than it already is.  They talk more about their lives than about sex itself.  If you want real sex advice stick to Dan Savage, he is true to his art.  
P.S. Emily if you choose to get a dog make sure you're grown up enough to take responsibility for it. An animal is not a toy. Grow up!"	1	Dragon Dear22	Blah!
2012-09-23 18:30:26	Just plain great PODCAST.  Love the personal approach, it's very refreshing!	5	esawyer40	One of the best!
2012-07-07 00:40:06	I spend a lot of windshield time on the highway. Your Podcast keeps me educated and entertained. Thank you for your Kegel Camp App. I am a 52 years young male, healthy and very health conscious.  Your Kegel Camp made a difference in my life. THANK YOU!	5	The Detail Man	Salute to a Beautiful Woman!
2012-08-26 23:22:08	"White menace is worth listening to. Emily is a verbal, up tight woman, afraid of real sex, just a big mouth trying to make a buck.
The emails they answer and the few invites are interesting and trendy. I'm ashamed of her behavior, want him!!!"	1	Karen (Michigan)	Karen
2012-08-21 15:50:03	"After sampling several episodes of this p-cast, I deleted the remainder and humbly returned to Dan Savage, never to stray again.  I will describe Sex w/ Emily as twenty-somethings droning on like teenagers about most anything except sex...drivel...blather.
Despite the fetching lass on the cover art, even if she were the last woman on earth, I'd pass on Sex with Emily."	1	Iswoon	Endless Futile  Babble
2012-08-20 21:59:31	"(This is getting one star only because i can't give it zero)
I've listened to two episodes. Both of which I skipped through all the ranting and didn't really get any good insight into anything other than the products the lady is trying to promote or what time her stupid show is on. This is so hard to listen to after being such an avid fan of the Sex Nerd Sandra Podcast. The host and her ""co-host"" are insufferable, vain, and he is so incredibly sex negative it's frustrating to listen to. Never again."	1	WDNtW	Sex Negative and Vain. Listen to Sex Nerd Sandra instead. Funny and insightful.
2012-08-09 09:44:04	The advise may be okay but it's not worth when the podcasters are constantly trying shill one of their products or shows.	1	Bruce Banner the third	10 minutes of advise 50 minutes of prompting her products.
2012-07-25 03:39:54	"Oh dear GOD do these people ramble on with some inane BS! I have tried to listen to different episodes and they follow a pattern. The host has an annoying nasal thing going on and she just ... well, Emily sounds kind of dumb. Also, It's pretty weird to have the voice of a 6-year old girl talking to you about sex into your headphones like some kind of self-appointed Tibetan effing guru of sex. She just confused ""porn star"" with ""stripper"", when referring to her guest's occupation. One involves sex for money - you know, p into v, or whatever, on camera... Her guest forgot to call-in, so Emily called her up. The lady didnt know who was calling and was like ""sorry, WHO is this?"" lol. Awk-waaaard. I officially declare NOPE to this podcast. Content seriously lacking - move along to the next one, folks."	1	Decrodedcrap	Insufferable listen. RAGE-DELETE
2012-07-20 13:21:44	"I like the show but a little bit could we get to the point? When I download a show I am interested in it bc of the title subject.  I DON'T WANT TO HEAR CHIT CHAT ABOUT NOTHING FOR 20 minutes first. 
Thanks. Let's cut the chit chat a little."	3	Hbaker86	Like it but...
2012-07-04 07:02:32	I have Downloaded and listened to every show to date. I like Emily and Menace  they are very hip and modern. I have not actually benefitted in my sex life but it's very nice to hear someone being open and honest about sex. Keep up the good work guys.	5	Pimp w limp	Insert title here
2012-05-31 23:31:12	I like it	5	R.i.p tupac	Good show
2012-07-03 04:52:22	I couldn't get past the first ten min of 'Emily' talking about how she loves attention from people and what a fluzzie she admits to being. Ummmmm... where is the sex talk? BooooOooooooring!	1	Redhaired Rider f the DreamWind	No thanks
2012-06-26 20:08:42	If I have to wait 20 minutes while the host calls her brother and talks celebrity gossip all the while making sure to name drop so we know how cool she is...what exactly is the purpose of her show??? Ugh. If people want real sex advice go elsewhere. Total waste of time	1	kemmer13	What sex advice???
2011-10-31 21:55:10	Best podcast since sliced bread!	5	dangerous.dabs	Sliced Bread
2012-04-25 04:08:13	"Emily was pretty good but my God the guy (Menace?) is narrow minded and argumentative for no reason.  Really ruined the podcast for me, particularly in the ""What Men Want"" episode.  These sex podcasts are supposed to be open and positive and that one just seemed to reinforce all the negative things about sex that these shows try to clear up."	2	eScotty	Half good, half bad
2012-04-18 04:45:13	Nothing of interest or substance on the show. Couldn't make it through a whole episode. Much prefer podcast by Sex Nerd Sandra.	1	Klsea11	Boring
2012-03-22 02:30:18	I didn't even get through one episode.  15 minutes in and she is still talking about all of HER (not sponsors of the podcast) various products, podcasts, websites, articles....blah, blah, blah....if she had gotten to an actual topic, she might have stood a chance, but I don't have time for all of that crap.  There are much better podcasts out there that actual talk about what their topic is.  I suggest the Savage Love Podcast and Sex is Fun; both are great.	1	Loves to laugh!	All about herself.
2011-11-15 05:33:46	I have mixed feelings about this podcast.  I like Emily, but I really don't like Menace. He's just boring and makes me wanna shoot myself when he talks.  Also, it seems ridiculous to have to pay for this podcast. I won't do it, esp when there are many more that are free.	2	Johnnygun3	Not paying!!
2011-09-21 22:53:15	She's sane, fun, and full of awesome information!!	5	Kimnegrete	Great info!!!
2011-09-17 17:13:44	There dynamic is wonderful & fun. Don't Believe all the hate in these reviews.	5	Kimberific	I love this show
2011-09-13 09:04:03	If you want to listen to 2 annoying dimwits who know nothing about sex then this podcast is for you. There is no content and on top of that they actually expect you to pay to listen to the full podcast. I don't even want to continue writing this review! Get a new job Emily and Menace!!!!!!!	1	Iago100fuegos	This is just God awful!
2011-06-13 22:24:14	You guys messed up. You are doing it backwards. Your numbers will fall and you won't get the dollars for your advertising. You should have get the money from marketing not the listners. Check out others doing it right. I love your show! I dont pay for tv shows the commercials do.Good luck.	4	jeffnic	WOW
2011-08-29 15:41:49	This is a good casual show that mostly talks about sex. It has a style of a morning comedy show rather than a sexy informative podcast. I just download the free best of podcasts and listen to them all once a week. Listening to a full show every day would be way too monotonous.	3	SaintFu	Morning Show
2011-08-23 20:36:30	I was a faithful listener before the new format. The actual show has great content, but what we get on iTunes now is just a tease to get us to pay to listen. The content is good, but with the other equally good, and in some cases better shows out there, I can't justify subscribing to the pay service. Check out Sex Nerd Sandra instead	2	Insane Trainer	Not what it used to be
2011-08-16 00:05:41	"I gave Sex With Emily a very honest try. Even when I finally gave up, I gave it another go. I wanted to like it but it didn't deliver what I wanted.
The information Emily provides is rarely sourced. Meaningful information is also very little and spread out thing. 
Menace is very uninterested and shuts down at lot of the casual conversation; forcing Emily to jump between topics or shoe horn personal stories. The casual conversations between Menace and Emily that are had are very superficial at best. Their relationship seems like they don't know each other exist outside of the show.
The information they provide is also very common and lack substance."	2	emoreno946	Unoriginal, tamed, forced, not good.
2011-08-02 10:03:02	I used to listen weekly but the new say for pay format has really turned me off, especially when there are better FREE alternatives to this show (IE: Savage love podcast) and it's a shame they felt a need to make this change.	1	2xPringles	Say for pay? Not for me...
2011-07-17 21:45:16	"If you don't mind your experts saying ""like"" like all the time, you may be ok with it."	2	namrofw	don't like
2011-07-11 21:26:25	This podcast can be funny and amusing only if you suspend any expectations of learning about sex. Sex advice dispensed in the show may be useful only for the most squeamish, but is generally not insightful. I did listen for awhile because it was free, but am definitely not paying for mediocre advise, redundancy, and listening to average Jane and Joe boasting about how great they are.	2	Belinda Staghammerr	Mediocre
2011-07-08 02:42:04	I loved this podcast...... UNTIL they made it a pay subscription podcast. This is a case of something good, getting greedy. I do get it.... every one wants to make money.  But come on.... $50 for a year??? I'm going to say I'm out!	1	TJones1005	Not Paying
2011-07-04 09:54:17	I have been a loyal listener for over a year now. I found the show funny, entertaining, and educational. But I can't afford to pay in order to listen. 4 stars for the show and content. 1 star for leaving the previous fan base totally behind. Good luck with your endeavors.	2	Orion18	It's been fun.
2011-07-02 16:32:08	"Great podcast which she now wants you to pay for.......feels like a great girlfriend that suddenly says you need to pay her in order to hang out with her.

I am just deleting you from my iPad."	1	Cal123w	Sold Out!
2011-06-30 01:31:05	"I listened for years, but can no longer do it.  While Emily might be knowledgable regarding sex, she has no business speaking about relationships and presenting the podcast as a ""sex and relationship"" podcast. I could accept that, if she brought on guests that would make up for this weakness, but this is all too rare.  If she called it simply a podcast on sex, that would be fine.  My major beef however is Menace.  He is so judgmental regarding sex and sexuality that do not fit within his ideal and throws around the stereotypes so much that it is becoming predictable and boring, when it isn't simply nauseating.  Now they expect us to pay for this irritation.  Paying for a dose of crabs would be more satisfying."	2	ipodoften	Relationship and sex unfriendly!
2011-06-28 05:30:50	Bad business plan. I am not paying for this. You are loosing your listeners	1	Rozentuhis	Bye bye
2011-06-24 12:48:14	"What the...?!  This new ""format"" is the lamest idea ever.  I've listened forever and now I have to pay?  Beware new listeners: this is no longer a free podcast.  You only get previews and they're mostly advertisements to subscribe.  Really disappointing, Emily."	1	Vemnox	Greed
2011-06-21 21:21:33	I used to listen to this podcast while running, at work, or working out but now with the podcast being broken down into 10 min bits its harder to listen.  Sorry Emily but I have to go, I can't been seen clicking my ipod all day work because you broke your podcast into these bite size chunks.	2	keykeyohio	Was good but now bad
2011-06-08 16:47:47	"with Emily or anyone else.
 On The Page (another podcast I enjoy) tried charging then had to return to free. Kim Komando and Rush Limbaugh are as far as I know the only two who successfully have a paid format. 
Good show though. Will miss you."	4	Ryfj	Won
2011-06-12 03:37:35	It was a good podcast until they started charging you to listen. It's not worth paying for IMO.	1	Stevied721	Charging for a once free service is ridiculous!!!!
2011-06-08 20:19:11	I used to be a very loyal listener, but since you now charge sorry not going to pay for a free podcast. I really did love the podcast.	2	Lordbuggin	Unhappy with new format
2011-05-30 02:14:19	"I find SWE very entertaining, And this is entertainment with some learning. 

With that in mind and remembering this is not a coarse at Sanford. Enjoy it and maybe you can learn something."	5	Tec.colo	SWE very entertaining
2011-06-03 16:38:19	Sorry to hear you guys have sold out! I am glad yahoo or google doesn't charge me to use their site, they use advertisers instead, I am not paying for your show, bad business plan on your part, you will lose your audience!!!!!!!!! I did think you had a good thing going too.	1	Big Dickman	Sold out
2011-05-28 22:04:44	Don't waste your time	1	Yahpee	Lame
2011-04-10 06:22:11	"This podcast is great because it's all the information with out the ""ick"" factor. Factual and informative, and only as graphic as it needs to be. Emily is open and honest and I trust her opinions on many things. I can only hope that when the time comes for me to be sexually active I will be able to use the information wisely for my benefit and his. Emily and Menace also have a great chemistry. Why aren't they dating?"	4	piglet2000	Exactly what I was looking for
2011-04-28 13:21:31	Oh my gosh she just sits there all talk about her boring life. I never like coming bad things, but she needs to know that what she's is doing is crap.	1	Noneed123	Most boring ever
2011-04-27 01:24:11	Nothing solid	1	JJInus	Not as good as expected at all
2011-04-25 21:42:06	I just wish it was a longer show!	5	SEMEYE	Great show, even better advice
2011-04-21 21:48:13	"I've finally given up on this podcast getting any better. I find them constantly revisiting the same topics with the same bland, uneducated advise every week. Menace is very sex negative, closed minded, and frequently derails the conversation. I often feel like the sex advice/news/talk is just treated as filler between the ads and personal plugs. Why the constant plugs?! The episodes with Emily interviewing knowledgable guests are good. I wish they'd gone with that format instead. I think Emily means well, but doesn't have enough experience yet to pull this off. Maybe someday, if she can muzzle Menace.

For a good version of this show try ""Sex Chat with Dr. Kat."" And if you're not squeamish ""The Savage Love Podcast"" is excellent."	1	Some Photo Nerd	Repetitive and useless.

2011-04-05 21:34:21	The hosts are a couple of people that need attention. They don't know that much about sex or relationships. I pity any woman foolish enough to have sex with someone as selfish as Menace. Emily is in deep denial about her own issues concerning relationships, and she didn't even know what a Sybian was until a few weeks ago.	1	one or another	Not worth the download
2011-02-19 03:22:40	"I have been listening to the podcast for more than 2 years. Emily is excellent and handles many taboo issues in a very graceful manner without using crude language that is often heard in podcasts dealing with sexuality. This helps anyone interested in relationships especially who are just starting to explore sexuality or are conservative (due to their upbringing, religion, environment etc) understand this complex issue with sensitivity and gentleness. 

She and Menace make a very good pair - Menace reflecting how men think, and Emily calming him down by sharing how women feel. Great show - just one suggestion Menace needs to be tone down his macho style a bit, he should be maturing with time and knowledge Emily shares about women. Good luck"	5	So True User	Emily is great in handling taboo issues with lot of grace
2011-01-27 23:00:45	"I have been listening for a long time.  Emily is a hottie with a sexy voice, and Menace adds some good stuff and humor.  Menace speaks his mind and is not the typical kiss butt sidekick who agrees with everything Emily says.  I'll admit I would enjoy if they did periodically add back some of the live guests and live calls that they had earlier, but even without it I still enjoy.  They keep it light and fun so it's not like listening to a lecture or other boring podcast.  It is not crude or vulgar but done tastefully.  Even if I can't listen right away I still save the podcasts and listen through them as soon as I can.  Sprinkling in some live broadcasts with listener interaction or even doing it live from a remote location like at a local bar might be fun to change it up a bit.

If you're looking for a clinical podcast with doctors this is not the one for you.  If you're looking for a juvenile podcast with excessive potty humor or sex jokes this is not the one for you.  If you want to enjoy while listening in the car or on the go with some good information and a few laughs, then subscribe and have fun."	5	LinnyDFW	I Listen Regulary
2011-01-09 01:57:56	.....since sliced bread	5	SloppySteve	best thing....
2010-12-30 23:33:26	Emily and Menace have great conversations about sex. They have a fun manter back and forth. Unfortunately with all the talk about sex Emily has decided actually having sex is not worth the trouble. She would rather spend her time putting together this blog than having some guy give her orgasms. I sure wish Emily would let loose and get laid.	5	Papagayo	Sure wish Emily would get herself laid
2010-12-09 19:44:29	Although at times, the her male counterpart seems to not enjoy anything to do with sex, Emily herself is beautiful, witty and has a wonderful radio voice. And she is stunning! One of my favorite podcasts now.	5	Buddy Out West	Emily is Beautiful
2010-12-08 00:02:20	I just love the podcast it is one of the few things that helps me get through the work week, I only wish there were more and longer episodes.	5	Tikimia9	Love It !

2010-11-22 20:25:35	"okay this is great. Mence makes the perfect counter points. including the best place for the special sauce. not listening to this only makes your sex life more boring & common place than it alreadys is.

peace world!"	5	rebel tommy	you! yeah you in the corner playing with yourself! you listen!
2010-11-08 22:51:01	It's good for the first couple of time. Than just like being married it gets stale, but hard to let go because u made a commitment to it....j/k the show is awesome.	5	Gamercore	Organism of the ear
2010-11-19 18:37:07	I remember now why i quit listening to this podcast 2 or 3 months ago. I can't stand the speed Emily talks and the constant interupting going on between her and Menace. I get why he is called Menace! She is constantly talking over the top of him. It's like she has so much to say that nothing else matters. Time to get away from this again. Self rightous, that's what Emily is.	2	rob465	annoying
2010-10-13 00:14:48	Just got hooked on Sex with Emily. Love the openness and the variety. Keep it up (pun intended!)	5	Pucksaver	What FUN!
2010-09-04 00:42:04	I rather enjoy listening to what Emily has to say, the show is brought down by Menace who always comes across as amazingly repressed, immature, and sex-negative considering he is on a show of this sort.  He may be playing a part to provide a counterpoint to Emily, but he just drags the show down.	4	Iskandur	She would be better on her own
2010-10-08 18:02:38	My girlfriend & I listen to every podcast! We love the show, menace & Emily are a lot of fun together, mainly because of their vast differences.. If you're looking for some fun advice, you can't do better!	5	JKazmeyer	Fun & sex positive
2010-09-20 06:12:12	Emily clearly knows her stuff but Menace doesnt seem confident in what he says on the air.  He seems way too shy and unsure on most things and I cant help but think that hes BSing about everything	2	85dave	Only one knows all
2010-06-12 15:01:39	I had to listen to a few episodes to realize that the hosts liked pushing each other's buttons and that they truly enjoy working together. This is the way sex talk should be: free, open and informative. It was refreshing to find people that can talk about the subject without shyness - just like I do. It makes my daily walk much more pleasant!	4	Nectarmaiden	Good show!
2010-08-18 03:18:29	"Emily is likeable enough and has a great voice for a sex and relationship advice show. But her sidekick ""Menace"" is an annoying, immature and inexperienced little twit who has no business giving anyone relationship or sex advice. Instead he offers his ""opinions"" about what he considers ""normal"" based upon what he and his shallow friends like. If Emily would drop him, her show could take off. But for better sex and relationship advice, I recommend the Savage Love podcast or Sex Is Fun podcast."	2	starwheel100	Sexy Voice but Goddawful Sidekick

2010-08-13 08:34:39	You don't really learn much, it's just fun listening to it.	5	ryguy48568	Fun to listen to
2010-08-09 22:20:25	Emily's show gives great REAL advice.  The show is fun, entertaining, and very informative.  I would recomend this show for couples and singles as Emily gives advice to EVERYONE!	5	Valkery	Great help
2010-08-05 19:37:44	Emily and Menace are a good team, love the great hand-job debate and they ate informational as well as entertaining :-)	5	idfoxx	Very Entertaining
2010-07-28 20:09:29	This is THE BEST show to listen to while I workout and the information is always right on! I listen to all of Emily's tips and my sex life has gone from good to GREAT! I subscribed so I don't miss a show...you should too!	5	Jessicandy	Best sex podcast around!
2010-07-22 22:59:09	Enjoyed this show for a bit as I listened to the older episodes but as I caught up I couldn't stand it anymore.  For the most part it is two self-loving hosts who want to talk about how hot they are.  Menace drives me nuts with his narrow minded approach to sex and disreagard for anything original (not even your hair BRAH).  So I honestly gave it a shot and am not just hating but if you are looking for some more down to earth and less tame advice/entertainment...check out Dan Savage's Savage Love Cast!	1	emalkin23	Had a decent run
2010-06-29 01:28:50	Thanks guys!!	5	Humping monkeys	Soooo entertaining
2010-06-24 05:15:49	I Jack off to this. Emily has a sexy voice	5	Icum	Yeahhh
2010-06-21 01:15:08	"This podcast is fun, informative and funny.  Emily has great guests and a very sexy way about her.  Her male counterpart - Menace - is no expert on sex or the true masculinity, but he is effective in articulating the ""cave man"" perspective to most issues about sex."	5	Greg 51	Great Subscription.
2010-05-27 19:14:03	"She is grate, awesome teacher with a wonderful voice. Emily is fast to response to her fans with accorate information. And her male sidekick is pretty kool. Keep up the good work. 

Also, I have to side with Minest, hand jobs are wack...

2010-03-29 19:14:34	I listen to the podcast all the time. It's so informative and it discusses alot of important topics. You're doing an awesome job, keep it up.:)	5	Kevy poo	I love it
2010-04-14 02:39:34	"She sounds like she's inhaled helium and that is probably the best thing about this show. Somehow Emily manages to talk too fast and ramble too much at the same time. The shows are too long for the content discussed as it could be covered in under 15 minutes. I'm not quite sure what I was expecting from a podcast with the title ""Sex With Emily"", but it was definitely something sexier and more intimate. A show featuring a thinking, articulate, sexy woman, rather than a woman wingeing about her mother, or her choice to be single, or reading her fan mail outloud and so she can rehash over-discussed previous show materials. Perhaps she's putting too much ""Emily"" into her show. I don't know. What I do know is I've gotten to the place where I'd rather listen to cats fight than another episode. Meh."	2	Sol Excited	She sounds like she's inhaled helium
2010-03-16 00:02:11	"In all honesty, the show used to be fantastic when it was a live radio show - lots of activity with callers and tons of guests.  Now that the show is on Stitcher and there is no opportunity for call-in's and for some reason there are no longer guests, the show is the same every week with Emily and Menace just chatting with each other, reading listener mail and reading news stories.  It is really getting old and now seems like many of the poor quality iTunes programs with one or two people just chatting with each other.

Emily is truly fantastic but the new format has really destroyed what was one of the best shows on iTunes.  Emily - please find some way to have callers (or how about a live studio audience so you can have lots of interaction if that's not possible) and please bring back weekly guests to liven the show up so you can go back to having the fantastic show you did!
"	1	iTunesRonald	Used to be much better - really downhill now that it's a Stitcher show
2010-03-11 04:17:17	"I love this podcast, it's great. First, Emily's voice is hot, and Menace is hilarious. The polarization of the liberal chick and the conservative guy is great!
I listen to this podcast on a weekly basis, and it definitely helped me.
Completely recommend it!"	5	rules45	Personalized, interactive, and shrewd
2009-09-29 01:49:22	I listen to Emily everyday at work (while delivering beer). I find her show very informative and exciting. Love you Em.	5	Warlock713	Great Show

2010-02-04 19:58:21	Emily is great but the show is plagued by Menace-.  This guy does not represent a fraction of the population, instead he is obviously hiding his true opinion since he got engaged. The guy admits to not liking porn. Seriously?	3	Adam Mza	Has so much potential.
2010-01-14 01:36:02	There are bad sex podcasts and then there are bad sex podcasts. Sex with emily is awful. It's like being at a bad slumber party with brainless wannabe hipsters.	1	Camille2.0	ugh
2010-01-04 18:37:29	i listed to about 25 episodes, and it just got worse and worse. the conversations/interviews are always lacking, the radio station association makes it way to sqeaky clean for a sex show, and i got really tired of hearing a professional talk about how hot she is. We get it... you've never been turned down or dumped. No one cares!	2	sarahal	i tried!
2009-08-11 13:55:30	I get the podcast on Itunes and listen on my commute. Love the show. It is always entertaining.	5	JD This is the last nickname I'm trying	Love Emily
2009-09-11 06:57:00	The host and various guests come off as very immature and narrow minded. I don't feel as if they really have a handle on the subject matter and therefore find it hard to enjoy anything they talk about. There are much better sex-related podcasts out there.	1	lulu11	Not my thing
2009-02-17 21:25:50	I love Emily - she is a great conversationalist - she was gone for a while and I missed her so much! Listen in - she is fun and sexy.	5	J-Roo	I love Emily
2009-02-11 15:25:46	Emily interviews a wide variety of people with a broad understanding of everything sexual. Used to listen every week, now it's more like semiannual. Hey Emily, every 6 months is too long between podcasts, how about stepping it up, your faithful fans miss you.	5	LouDog206	Where have you been, Emily?
2008-07-29 14:38:23	I loved this podcast! It's funny, and very informative. 	5	Aychi	Great!
2007-12-08 07:07:04	Love Emily and can't wait till the next edition. Always good, entertaining, educating, having fun, gives you something to talk about at your next party. Thanks, Emily	5	director1742	Great listening, entertaining, makes you think...
2008-07-08 20:36:38	Host and many guests come across as shallow and narrow-minded.  Not the place to go if you want to hear accurate information about sex and relationships.	1	JumpinBean	You can find a lot better elsewhere
2007-11-14 01:42:16	You can tell that Emily and her staff really care about spreading the gospel of healthy sexual fun and education. Not only are they smart and sexy, but they are heartfelt and fair-minded.I appreciate Emily's dedication to the subject and the new information that she brings to the community.	5	BerkeleyPetey	Smart and Sexy!
2007-11-13 16:25:13	"Stumbled across this podcast a long time ago... not only have I gotten great practical tips, listening to the podcast itself is a great conversation starter (and ""more"" starter)."	5	davidbressler	Awesome - my #1 must listen
2007-11-13 14:12:16	The podcasts from Sex with Emily are really a welcome window into today's conversations about sexuality.  Having been raised in the '50s, when any conversation about sex was discouraged, we missed a lot of information.  I have to say that (in my early 70s) I'm still learning.  And, the podcasts are fun! Keep up the good work, Emily.	5	Ed'n'Sue	Educational (and, Fun!!)
2006-07-27 12:56:57	I love you Emily...Great show, keep up the good work! :)	5	Jason F.	Such a good show! I am addicted!
2007-05-15 03:01:53	BEST theme song in the podcasting world ('cept maybe DVD Digigods and BoxOffice DVD Roundup)What IS the name of that song? Semi-interesting podcast by a ditzy ex-stripper type girl. Though she sometimes has interesting topics, with interesting girls, Emily herself seems too dim-witted and unknowing about the world to really be interesting week after week. Dr. Ruth is quite a bit more interesting, even having more frank sexy talk. Maybe with more experience, sexually, Emily could come across better.Walt D in LV	3	Walt D in LV	Nice but almost boring
2006-07-04 21:06:26	This is a great podcast . . . always interesting, exciting & informative!	5	Don In Derby	Great Show
2006-06-21 10:53:09	This is a re-broadcast of her radio show. The topics are old and have be discussed over and over by many other podcasts and shows. She constantly plugs the radio station and constantly cuts off callers before they are done. Sorry, but the show just isn't that great.	2	Radink	Repetative and unoriginal
2011-03-07 02:52:25	I love the podcast but they need 2 be more often because they are the highlight of my day but I never get to here new 1s!	4	Applover229	Good but..
2006-05-31 19:32:17	Although I don’t think that I would ever be involved with many of the situations discussed, I was still curious.Thanks, Emily.	5	WoodyOO	Interesting
2006-05-30 03:53:20	Emily has the most sexy voice for starters...and her topics are always sexy, fun, and informative too. Definitly an awesome podcast. 	5	*Perseverance*	Hot And Fun
2010-12-10 05:04:57	She's sounds pretty hot and totally carries the show. He sounds like a 7th grade nerd who's uptight and ruins the show..how can you cohost a show about sex and not appear to even like to talk about sex?	2	Mdav49	Terrible sidekick
2011-03-11 23:43:58	I am not quite sure what I wanted from this podcast but tales of people recounting trivia of sex parties strikes as the height of banality.	2	Tinman_01	Boring
2011-04-02 04:46:18	Awesome	5	Liveinxs	Awesome
2010-12-21 14:48:49	Entertaining and educational. If you want to spice things up in the bedroom Emily and Menace can help you out.	5	Ekalbsgirl	Great Podcast

The content sometimes makes my eye's widen, but I really wanted to say how relaxing I find it to listen to Dan giving his advice and in his conversations with people.  I was also deeply touched by his shout-out to mums on Mothers Day.  Thanks Dan.  Im a fan.	5	My 10 cents	El Fyona

2015-11-20 20:08:19	If you find relationships and human interactions confusing as hell, Dan Savage articulates the nuances so well. This podcast helps me keep an open mind and open heart with friends, family and strangers. Feel like the world would be a more understanding place if everyone got a bit of Savage Love in their life.	5	Love at first byte	Jadestopthat
2015-06-02 10:12:17	I’ve been a long-time listener and reader of Savage Love/Cast and all these past few years have ‘passed' on checking out the Magnum Version. I finally did it (only $5 for one month) because I was searching for info on a topic. Magnum is infinitely more intricate, intimate and informative than the regular-ol’ Lovecast, while it offers the Savage standard social, sexual, political commentary and outstanding wit. I was absolutely missing out by not hearing the Magnum Version and now I’m happily accessing all the old 'casts from years gone by. I’ve gratefully and smartly upgraded to the yearly offer. Totally worth it - and commercial free! Thanks Dan, Nancy and the ‘TSARY’!!	5	MAGNUM is TOO GOOD!	Mawesy
2015-05-13 13:45:29	Thank you dan savage for saying everything that I daren't think (but secretly hope for). I feel like your advice is so warm and kind yet also beautifully clever and savage - you feel like a favourite uncle who is there to give friendly wise advice. Thank you for guiding me when I feel lost.	5	I LOVE uncle Dan!	Aurorapowers
2014-07-03 03:50:23	A friend recommended Savage Lovecast and it's changed my world.

2013-11-04 03:41:42	This is an incredible podcast. Dan is smart, funny, and totally on point about relationships. He's completely changed my way of thinking, and I only wish more people would get on board with his very intelligent views.	5	Must Listen	katebug777

2012-02-06 10:19:24	Dan makes me swoon and I think he should be everyone's podcast sweetheart. you'll learn heaps of things and probably become a better person. You'll definitely become better at dumping people, which is something we all need.	5	It's real love	Jack Tuelove

2008-01-21 13:39:20	He is highly entertaining but most importantly, his advice is straight to the point and absolutely logical even though the weird, funny, strange and all the other categories his callers fall into (putting it nicely!) might not see it through their foggy pink glasses. Highly recommend it! 	4	Fantastic! 	RiceBubbles
2020-01-28 17:55:28	Whether I can identify with the caller or not, I almost always agree with Dan‘s advice. Every episode I get to learn something new and feel better and more comfortable with my own stuff as well.	5	Great Advice!	Sisiwasabi
2012-08-21 13:28:23	Best podcast about sex and relationships ever. Obviously a bit US centric but apart from the initial rants love and Dan Savage's advice are universal.	5	Best. Ever.	CKoeBe
2022-02-04 16:37:23	I’ve been reading Savage Love for 2 decades and I love him. He is funny. He is smart. He is empathetic. He is open. Enjoy ❤️	5	Dan is fantabulous	casaburman

The first ten minutes are spent whining about Trump. We get it. We have to live with it. The lovecast used to be a reprieve from all the garbage in the news
Get over it Dan"	1	The podcast has gone way downhill	Keyt543
2020-01-08 19:25:23	Been reading since the 90s. The podcast is even better. I love his opening monologue. It’s concise and informative,actually wish he’d expand on it and do a popculture/politics podcast tbh. The questions never let you down in terms of weird, wild and wonderful. The only thing I miss are the hilarious acronyms people used to use as names in the column. That should be a thing in the podcast. Haha!	5	Great	PrincessShilo

2016-03-25 06:49:59	I'm Dan's age and really wish I knew of him and his thoughts when I was 18, although it may not have been quite as good as it now.  His advise now has really helped mould me into a much better, more caring and more understanding person.  I admire you and thank you Dan for all your words of wisdom.  I'm a proud Magnum supporter.  Great show.	5	A Greater Perpective on Relationships and Sex	Johnnie McgG

2016-01-28 19:31:15	"Long-time listener, my rating on this would have been 5 stars a few years ago but have to downgrade it.  I find the Lovecast has become heavy on Dan's political commentary, it's increased over time with his public notoriety.  

Props to Dan for his success, I support his views.  But as a non-American I'm not needing 20 minutes of long-winded ranting, preaching to the choir. I want to get to the goods, the calls!  

Love the phone calls and relationship advice, have to fast-forward through the politics though."	3	More relationship advice, less politics please	Lizbun
2015-12-20 21:50:44	I LOVE Dan Savage but this show is more than just him. It is his amazing guests and listeners who allow him to say some of the smartest and most impactful things.

I would be way more apt to listen regularly if I had some kind of idea about the subject matter. Otherwise, a great commuting podcast!!	3	Great Show... No synopsis	MaijaJP

2013-08-21 00:15:07	I've been listening to Dan's show since the very first episode. If you like his podcast you should really check out the Magnum Feed ($ubscription) version. The shows are double in length and there are no ads. Great interviews too. I've gone Magnum and I can't go back!	5	Like this? You'll love the Magnum Feed	cat5343

2013-08-02 11:52:16	"I've been listening to Dan Savage's podcasts for years.  I'm a gay male.  It's always been the show I turn to when I have nothing else to listen to- this is for a few reasons.

1) Dan's cynical tone is in no way helpful.  I listen to plenty of podcasts with 'tough' hosts, which is fine.  But Dan at times gets so worked up in his responses that I feel he's just doing it to get people talking.  I wouldn't mind just hearing a simple answer to a questions from time to time.  Everytime that caller stops talking I know I'm about to get some ridiculously loud and out-of-control answer (which often could have been said in a few words).

2) Way too much intro at the beginning of the show.  Sometimes he answers under 6 quesitons a show.  Not enough, and certainly not enough for me to buy this premium Magnum deal.

3) Doesn't it seem like some of his responses are for shock-value instead of to help?  'DUMP THE MOTHER...' gets old real fast.

Can we get a reboot of this show with someone younger and ready to do this?  So many props to Dan for all he's done.  No doubt he has shifted much of a generation and had significant impact on politics at times.  But I think it's time for him to step down."	3	Ready for a Reboot	Hypnotics
2013-06-21 00:36:18	"What I love about Mr Savage is his no holds barred approach to the questions he is asked. Not only is he knowledgable, but if he doesn't know the answer, he admits it and looks elsewhere in his wide range of doctor/specialist friends. Whether straight, gay or something in between, this podcast is for you and might even help you learn more about yourself. 
Personally, I can listen to this podcast (and I listen to MANY different podcasts) for a whole 5 hour car ride."	5	best podcast of the sort.	Skyman48863
2013-06-11 14:58:55	Dan has a way with words, he is able to articulate in such a way that you can't help but not agree with him (most of the time).	5	Open your mind	Djfsmx
2013-02-13 03:55:09	Always has answers (or knows someone who does) for myriad questions and problems!	5	Dan is awesome!	h0p31355
2012-09-25 15:14:36	In an era when sex education and questions about sexuality can be less than comprehensive, Dan's fearless and straight-talking (so to speak) advice and commentaries are a must-hear.	5	A must-hear if you want to know about sex and sexuality	Plainsez
2013-01-22 18:12:52	The host is not one to be giving sexual advice and comes off as annoying.	1	Awful	Phillythrilly

2012-09-06 01:55:36	I give Dan 2 thumbs up. Best advice in town...and surprisingly useful! ;-) Now if only I could ram it down other people's ears, the world would be a better (and more GGG) place. Rock on!	5	Nothing but good common sense	EurekaB72

2012-06-01 02:48:04	"I honestly feel like the opposite of only abstinence sex has gone WAY too far so much that its just as detrimental. I'm a Canadian 21 year old atheist but now see SO many problems in people thinking exploring sexuality ( safe) with a billion partners is Gunna lead to them being healthy and happy above all else.  That if everyone just had 10 vibrators and had safe casual sex all the time, and have no regard for developing their own values or opinions about their body and what may be healthiest for them emotionally. Sex is an easy thing to get far too consumed in leads young people to have un healthy attitudes.  This obsession with sex for it or against it is really disturbing.  to imply people with strong emotions / values / and morals toward sex and sexuality  are just "" sexually repressed  "" rather than people who just have morals and  emotions tied to their sexuality is hurtful and detrimental. People who don't share the abstinence only mentality  feel forced to explore sexuality even if they don't feel comfortable. Which is just as hurtful as the latter."	1	No middle ground	Jhill4546778
2012-05-31 11:25:30	The host takes all aspects of sex, sexuality, relationships unflinchingly by the horns and delivers responsible and reasonable advice to real people's problems fascinating and familiar alike.

2010-06-01 07:52:11	Once I got hooked, I devoured the back-episodes. I may have listened to all of them. Smart, insightful, funny, and always worth the listen. I don't always read his column, but I wouldn't miss a podcast for anything short of an apocalypse.	5	Really great	EveryoneKnows

2009-07-14 04:15:46	Without a doubt one of the best podcast out there , he's entertaining, educated, and tackles the issues straight up.I also like the idea of callers with questions , it helps us the listeners with questions that we might have wanted to ask, a great variety of questions as well, everyone is different therefore everyone brings different topics issues of ALL kinds which you can even imagine.Another important thing i don't find he goes off topic and , the episodes stay true to it's point unlike some which tackles some issues and then go off topic with their personal life experience that can last half an hour. Dan you are great keep it up!!!	5	WOW	shasha84
2009-07-06 04:43:15	I often find myself repeating some of his advice for people all around me.he's very frank and knows his stuff. Comedy is always a plus	5	Excellent....smart and hilarious	Smugfrog
2008-11-30 14:12:39	Dan shows no fear in bringing his considerable wit, perceptiveness, intelligence and experience to answering a broad range of sex- and relationship-related questions.

2007-04-06 18:08:17	This man knows his stuff. No easy way out for the timid and the shy. Don't ask a question you don't want the bold, blunt, explicit answer to.

The quality, quantity and bare bones delivery are what is exactly needed in this field. 	5	Savage rules.	jrhather

2022-12-27 12:44:17	"Review from 🇩🇰
Kinda boring to listen to, not a very clear pattern in the point of the episodes and a name that doesn’t really keep its promises tbh. I am not native but practically fluent in english, which might be why I get every word of it but not necessarily every US-cultural reference.

2015-07-16 20:40:06	"I've been listening for a couple of months now after hearing of Dan for the first time on the Longest Shortest Time podcast. As a UK listener I love that Dan takes the time to comment on american social justice and equality issues at the start of the show. A lot of these stories don't make it into UK press but I love being able to share them with friends. I am usually so entertained and intrigued by the variety of personal questions people call to ask about that I rarely pause, but this week I had to pause to immediately sign the change.org petition. For a relationships podcast to both inform and entertain is not an easy feat and Dan is as much an activist as a journalist which I really respect. I look forward to Tuesday every week now!

2017-05-26 10:18:35	Savage definitely knows his stuff. He is always giving really insightful comments on relationships. The main problem is that he also uses his show as a political platform. He is constantly bashing the American right, I'm not saying he has to stay 100% clear of it but it doesn't end. He goes on and on about how evil the Republicans are and it is often not relevant and usually tiring and boring. He is also slightly mean. He will sometimes get a question that mentions an opinion he does not agree with and he will then say something that I think is uncalled for.	3	Smart But Goes Off Topic	yonischott

Rating wise, it does sometimes delve into the mechanics of an•l s•x, f•sting, healthiness of sc•t play, and alleged s•x with dolphins.

2023-04-01 20:42:23	"Re: Bonus Episode on April 1st

Long-time listener here. I get that you may have done this episode as a “practical joke” on this occasion for April Fool’s but if so, there was literally nothing funny about it. I decided to stop listening after listening to Dan’s responses to the first three calls because the diatribe of condescension just because too much. This podcast is supposed to be informative and entertaining, right? Not voyeurism of Dan Savage punishing listener for what he seems to deem stupid questions.Not only were his responses entirely unhelpful and patronizing but the pattern of condescension to some listener calls over time has become cringe worthy and honestly feels like an embarrassing glimpse into Dan’s misplaced sense of superiority and the ugliness living inside of his mind. Treating so many of these listener calls as if the callers were stupid, especially in such a public way, speaks volumes about Dan rather than embarrassing the callers as he seems to intend to do when “roasting them.” It’s just gotten dark, Dan. I know you’re going through it with your injured shoulder but cope, my man. Or don’t record the episode at all if you’re going to be this vicious to some of your callers. Or just pick different listener calls to answer where you’re actually answering the question and not just cutting the person down to size.

Honest feedback, man. It’s not healthy to be this vicious to people, let alone so publicly. And I’m not just talking about this particular episode. I hope you give it some sincere thought and don’t just discard this as criticism. All the best."	5	Re: Bonus Episode April 2, 2023	all the nicknames are taken009

This is one of the best podcast on sexual relations for anyone to listen to even though it is pointed primarily to the heterosexual audience everyone can learn some thing from this podcast even if you are a thoroughly highly sexual person he’s interesting is poignant he’s to the point and I’m glad there’s someone like him out there in the world	5	Don’t overlook this podcast	Rob P H

2022-02-03 14:31:02	Stopped listening to Dan a couple years ago, but decided to give him a chance again.  I enjoy listening to the caller questions and thinking about their perspectives.  Unfortunately, Dan has basically turned into the Rush Limbaugh of the left.  (FYI I’m very left leaning politically.). I stopped listening again because instead of feeling inspired, informed, and empowered, I feel angry, despondent, and anxious.  I truly believe he has no interest in issues of social justice.  Much like the talking heads of Fox News, he uses fear, anger, and toxic masculinity to whip up outrage and chaos.	1	Just can’t do it…	JJJJ8686

2021-05-30 04:28:38	"This podcast is extraordinarily helpful and enlightening when it comes to sex. 
I've listened to it for many years and it's been a great tool. 

Dan has long had a tendency toward hard-line positions and has found himself entangled with the Right and the Left. He's a ""cultural Catholic"" and maintains a lot of stringent moralism. I think that this occassionally gets him into approaching subjects with less compassion and more detachment than you'd expect from what is often a super-sharp analytical intelligence.

2021-01-19 18:47:02	I redone loaded this app just to review this podcast (I switched to a different app with a better interface a while ago). I love Dan’s advice and political rants, but this podcast has the worst ads of any of the dozens I’ve listened to. A lot of podcasts have a members-only paid subscription version with zero ads, but even the regular free versions of those podcasts have far fewer ads. With the Lovecast, there are long commercial breaks in between not only every segment, but every call. It’s incredibly annoying and disjointed. I stopped listening for just this reason. There are a load of other sex advice podcasts that are just as good, if not better, with far fewer interruptions. Listening to the Lovecast reminds me of the days before streaming television, when an hour-long show would really only have like a 35-min runtime because of commercials.

Seriously dan take 20 min out of your day and listen to the other side and see if your thoughts on politics change once you have all the facts and have listened to both sides, I recommend the Ben Shapiro show although you might disagree you won’t be able to say he is wrong try it be honest with yourself"	2	Fake dan has been brainwashed by a fake news	Thl2eat

2020-07-18 20:34:04	I’ve listened to Dan weekly since 2007 and I can’t think of one episode I didn’t enjoy. From the rants at the top of the show to the consistently sound advice, this podcast is a gem. Dan’s outlook on sex and relationships helped deprogram my brain after a particularly religious (Mormon) upbringing. I can honestly say that I don’t know where I would be without this podcast. Love ya, Dan!	5	If you only do one thing today, listen to Savage Love!	kjersten z

2020-06-04 12:19:47	After a decade of listening, I heard Dan start the podcast with “F- the police.”.   I deleted that episode and unsubscribed because I can’t trust anything he says now.  What a stupid remark to make.  Dan preaches against making assumptions about a person based on a group he/she is in, but he doesn’t practice what he preaches.	1	Disappointed	TJN2342
2020-04-07 17:23:10	Omg !!! Where do I even start ? I love your podcast with a deep passion... I think I’ve listened to so many podcast from 7 yrs ago that sometimes I have the same answer you would give... 😁. Keep up the great work.	5	Hi Dan,	vcxdffgcsd
2020-05-02 01:58:14	I was a loyal listener and supporter of this podcast for years. I purchased my annual tickets to HUMP film FESTIVAL months ago before the covid-19 crises. Like so many Americans I have been affected financially and need to scrape pennies to get by. The FESTIVAL is no longer taking place. So naturally I asked for a refund and was my request was denied. Disgusting how a profit is trying to be made in this climate.	1	Exptremely disappointed	Jaime !!!
2020-03-21 13:15:11	I listen to a lot of podcasts and this is one of only a few that I always listen to as soon as it's released. Excellent sex and relationship advice that has really helped me heal from a very sexually repressed religious upbringing.	5	excellent podcast	Scubadoc16

2020-02-14 07:32:35	I used to be a fan but a recent diatribe at the beginning of his podcast about ring made me lose all trust in Dan. He clearly didn’t do his research and instead took an article written by a political  lobby (EFF) as fact. Also, very concerning bias expressed by Dan regarding Ukrainian people. So disappointed.	1	Lost all trust	leilalei

2020-01-29 06:42:28	I’ve been a Dan fan for decades. Years ago, A reviewer used the phrase “devastatingly funny wit” to describe him. Quite apt. I don’t agree with him on everything, but his sex-positive message is one everybody needs to hear.	5	“Devastatingly funny wit”	Brad4ever1
2020-01-01 02:29:21	I love listening to this podcast!	5	Such a great show!	Sturtyboy
2020-01-29 03:29:05	I understand that money rules the world but I’m heartbroken that the “micro-podcast” don’t include any of the interview in every episode anymore. Between my own hereditary diseases/health issues, taking care of my father with lung cancer/other ill family members and trying to make a living working two jobs I don’t have a disposable income for podcasts. I 100% agree with making some content extra for financial gain but I’ve literally listen to every episode and he used to include some of the interviews which was the highlight of my week. Dan Savage is always a good listen but I wish my finances would allow me listen like I used to and enjoy instead of only catering to the disposable income.	3	I love this podcast but wish I could more	ndusnwowhe
2019-12-15 18:24:34	I like to know how people different from myself experience the world, it makes it easier to take other people into account.  Dan brings all sorts of things to light, and his listeners contribute endlessly to the content of the show.  Bravo!	5	Keeping me informed!	dooblivey
2019-12-18 00:39:02	I like this show. I love Dan’s voice. He has sharp wit and usually spot-on with his advice. It’s cool when he talks about  his own personal experiences, from his life being a homosexual man raised in a Roman Catholic household, to his mother, whom  he adored. He is compassionate, even with the callers who are annoying and kind of clueless.  I love his sense of humor. I know I’d get along w him, except that I’m a Trump supporter. I usually fast forward through his opening remarks when he talks politics. Many others do too, idk. I can’t be the only Trump supporter listening, but heck, maybe I am. He has vile contempt for someone like me. His rants about current political issues are rife with bias, arrogance, and false information.  He’s like the male version of Rachel Maddow. But I forgive him for this, bc the other parts of his show are entertaining. But come on, take the political ranting elsewhere. It’s a disservice to your listeners , and insulting to our intelligence. Not everyone lives in GayLand who listens to your show. And not all gays are leftists.   Stop the  propaganda propagation. And stick to what your show is supposed to be about.	2	Topic of Show says ...Sexuality	Goxtixgcfftcypkojg
2019-12-05 22:16:25	I’ve listened to this podcast for about a year, and it’s a can’t-miss each week. I love how real and down to earth Dan is, and the variety of questions that are taken. Keep up the good work!	5	Great Advice on a Variety of Topics	eaglee74
2019-12-10 17:01:27	"I frequently enjoy listening to Dan’s advice and rants, even when I may disagree with some of his points.  It’s great having a sex-positive perspective to listen to with the occasional turn into the unexpected.  The best advice usually comes when he brings in a guest expert.

I knock the rating down a bit mainly because his stances on polyamory and cheating verges too readily on the side of magically fixing relationship issues.  In some cases, they may work, but he often glosses over the responsibilities & communication that should be addressed in the primary relationship first.  If you don’t tackle that, which often seems to be the case, then polyamory or cheating is an excuse to unfairly take advantage of and drag on a relationship that really should just end.  Take care of yourselves & remember to take care of each other."	4	Mostly helpful & entertaining	dustheim
2019-11-30 17:17:27	I’ve always loved this show. Didn’t think I could love it more until callers started using their voice memo app on their phone to record their questions instead of calling in.  The audio quality is a hundred times better!  Even more excited for episodes to drop on Tuesday now.	5	Longtime fan	Milkistoospicy
2019-11-18 15:56:37	Noooooo!!!!! Always a great show, just was in the middle of like season 2 or 3 and it’s now gone. Nonetheless I’m still going to listen to this show it has always helped me and thank you!	5	Noooo!!!!!	doodlebop73

2019-08-25 07:57:48	This is still one of the podcasts I look forward to every week! Entertaining, inclusive, informative- Dan Savage rarely disappoints. He has the integrity to admit when he makes the wrong call, and brings in guest experts when a question is out of his wheelhouse.

2019-08-19 23:24:28	Back in the day, Dan used to have fresh takes on things but he's grown into just another old white man who doesn't grow with the times. I appreciate his liberalness and enjoy his top of the show rants but he has some major blind spots when it comes to women (especially fat women), race, and porn/sex work issues. He's blindly pro-porn, pro-prostitution, and viciously anti-monogamy. You are allowed to have your opinions on these topics, but I just wish he would better himself (especially as someone who is giving advice to people) by being more connected to the nuances and evolving consciousness of these issues. PS read Lindy West's Shrill.	2	Major blind spots	Thisnamereallycantbetaken

2019-07-04 18:21:12	This podcast changed my life for the better. i’ve been listening for the past three years. Since I started listening to this podcast I ditched my toxic relationship (I didn’t realize how terribly i was being treated until listening to this podcast) and have since found so much more joy in my life. Constantly encouraging you to open your mind to all different forms of relationships and embrace your sexuality.	5	Life changing	Ziggy0218
2019-08-07 15:23:40	I really like when dan actually discusses relationships, sex and dating advice. It’s been very eye opening and helpful in validating a lot of my sex positive values. But when Dan goes off on long political rants, (on Trumps, Gun rights, immigration) it just distracts from the main point of the show and he does so in such a distasteful way. All I ask is that he have a little more respect and open mindedness, not all conservatives or even trump supporters are bad people. It’d be even better if he could stay away from politics and focus on the actual subject of the podcast.	4	Good podcast but stick to sex please	broaar
2019-07-02 02:21:57	It's true a frightning it is to have your parents meet your same sex partner. But you'll truly never know until you do it.

2019-06-13 00:59:10	I first discovered this podcast when a friend suggested it during a road trip and I've been a reader and a listener ever since.  I don't always agree with Dan's advice, but I find that he makes compelling arguments and has helped to open my mind to a lot of sexual lifestyles and issues that I'd never considered or given much thought to.	5	Fun!

2019-06-15 13:53:22	all though i agree with most of the things dan savage says, i find the way he communicates his opinions incredibly rude on the listeners expense.	2	be a tad more respectful	meta cov
2019-06-02 06:22:24	"The rants/monlogoues at the top of the show are fine, but the real meat of this podcast is people calling in to ask their rawest, most intimate, sometimes sad, sometimes hilarious, almost always interesting sex, relationship, family (and occasionally) etiquette questions; stuff they wouldn’t even ask their best friend, lover, or closest confidant, in many cases. That’s why I tune in — it’s like the realest reality TV show out there, in podcast form.  

And the beauty of it is, you get to play “advice columnist” right along with Dan, answering callers’ questions as you listen and seeing if you agree with Dan’s takes or not. It’s a great listening experience, and there’s always listener comments at the end of every episode."	5	Raw, Real and Entertaining	Jack_McCoy

2019-04-16 09:31:21	Hi Dan, I love the pod and it’s on my list of things to support financially this year, but that’s not why I’m writing a review.  I just downloaded a few podcasts simultaneously for offline listening and (despite having started the download of your podcast first) noticed that your download took 3-4x longer to download than 2 other podcasts that were twice as large in file size!  Is this throttling on my end, your end, by Apple, by Metro PCS (my telecom), or a fluke?  I don’t mean to unnecessarily raise the censorship alarm, but it’s something you might want to look into.  Okayyyy, peace, love, and butt stuff!  - Rachel The Polterzeitgeist	5	Are you being throttled?	Polterzeitgeist
2019-04-11 01:27:23	"I really wish that I could spend an hour in person with Dan - I know it would be life changing as he firmly whipped the silly fairytales from my expectations while warmly replacing that space with fulfilling expectations. Until that time, I will listen to him twice weekly (yes also on Blabbermouth) and let him guide me through the tales of others. 

Also he helped me get out of a really toxic relationship and for that I am eternally grateful. DTMFA. ☺️"	5	DTMFA	Anon42332

2019-03-14 12:16:09	Thanks to my sex-positive (NOT raised Irish Catholic!) Friend Joy, I started reading Dan Savage’s column in our (then) SAN Francisco free weekly paper and now in our Detroit Metro Times Free weekly paper. By some magic of the Internet, I found “America’s ONLY advice columnist on a FREE podcast when I was unemployed but had a wonderful T-Mobile unlimited data plan thanks to a friend with whom I had a “Family Plan.” Today I am going to figure out how to subscribe to the Magnum Edition! Why? I can afford it, finally, and The TRIGGER Edition did not trigger me. I plan on tweeting or calling as well but I was listening closely and when Dan said, (something close to) “strange as it may seem, not all child sexual abuse perpetrators are pedophiles,” I made the decision to get the Magnum Edition. I wish the 12, 13, 14 year old version of myself had had Dan Savage’s advice! (I’ve had years of therapy that may or may not have been averted!!!)4	5	Thanks Joy!	CMKFish

2019-03-11 02:03:38	I’m a woman in my early thirties, and I’ve listened to/read Dan Savage since I was a teenager. I was lucky enough to have great(ish) sex Ed in school, but Dan’s outlook and advice helped me become more sexually aware and confident than I would have been otherwise. My friends and I regularly toss around catchphrases like “that’s the price of admission”, “is that GGG behavior?”, and “just because your relationship ended doesn’t mean it was a failure!” - it’s kind of awesome that a large group of kickass millennial women have been so positively indoctrinated by this Gen X married father.

2019-02-15 16:54:31	"Dan - I agree that it's messed up sex workers are getting mistaken for sex trafficked people.  The restaurant in NYC that banned single women from its bar is especially nasty.
However, I wish you'd have touched on one related issue.  We are living in a state of hyper, extreme, over the top political correctness.  We are encouraged to be constantly outraged.  Consequently, the fastest, surest way to popularity or more likes on Facebook is to either be a victim or find one to champion.  I am confident that the hotel workers and restaurant workers who posit that they've identified people being sex trafficed are doing it at least in part because they know it will get them a lot of positive attention from the media."	1	Dan's Rant About Sex Workers Confused for Sex Trafficing	Profesor Franchise

2018-11-13 20:09:34	Ok. Just listened to the recent episode of this podcast.  It was excellent.  I've been a magnum subscriber for a few years and thought I heard most things and enjoy seeing if I can predict how Dan is going to handle the calls.  This episode had some new issues (alcoholism on a spectrum?) and a heart-wrenching story at the end. Enjoyed hearing Dan filter through the rough bits and get to the heart of the issues. AND, Nancy Hartunian put her stamp on an issue. Thanks for your good work, Dan and Nancy and Lovecast workers.	5	This one #629	PriveledPLD
2018-12-05 14:53:01	"I’ve been listening to Dan for years, but his inability to leave 2016 behind caused me to unsubscribe. I’m done with his not infrequent top of the show bashing of Bernie and progressives who have a sense of morality beyond “it’s ok if the Democrats do it.” 

There are plenty of other podcasts out there that, I don’t need one that insults people who fight against inequality and constantly divides the Democratic Party."	1	Not bad advice, terrible politics	TheMisanthrope
2018-11-30 10:59:00	"Years ago dan was fresh, funny , edgy and witty. Now he’s judgemental of whatever he deems to be not PC. He’s very critical of straight het “cis” men. Anyone who uses the term cis is an idiot.
He adopts the acronym , trendy description and victim class of the week. 
Most of Calls are from cowards that can’t be honest . He spends fifteen minutes telling them to honest. Over and over again.
The first 15 min is a political pro Lbqtxyz whatever rant. The free show has devolved into constant commercials. I’m afraid to buy a magnum paid one because it might auto subscribe me and bill my card forever. 
The last straw is where is advises people with STDs to not disclose and possibly infect people. And he demands guys get vasectomies (fine) because women don’t want to use their 12 different available birth control types. Because they’re spoiled princesses. Men are always wrong, women with whatever plumbing are always right per Dan.
I do like the anti dog rants."	2	Past his prime	Ressaw2011

2018-09-19 22:26:40	I listen to Dan Savage for life and relationship advice more than sex advice. His approach to dealing with situations and people is useful and helps me have clarity in my own life, whether or not it’s related to sex or love. Thanks, Dan!	5	Not just for sex advice	meganificent
2018-09-13 14:40:09	Have been listening for about 5-6 years, and now listen every Tuesday. Dan is doing a societal service. The honesty and directness on this topic is necessary, since the world is still recovering from Puritan and Victorian conceptions of gender and sexuality, and shutting down of real human emotions. Dan’s like “no, let’s not lie about these things.” Thanks Dan.	5	Awesome	Snowbunnysunny
2018-08-29 05:51:26	Started listening during the heat of 2016 election right after moving to the reddest red dot you can find in Montana. This podcast gave me some sense of belonging and normalcy during a particularly difficult time for, well, all of us! (Now I'm back in a blue dot in Montana, so please don't worry. 😉) Though I thought I knew a lot about human sexuality before, listening has really challenged some of my assumptions- especially about negotiating relationship structures and monogamy by default. And I've found the language to describe my own sexuality! The range of topics is always surprising and keeps me coming back.	5	You belong here too!	juuuuust.jancee

2018-08-15 02:54:42	I started reading Savage Love in the Chicago Reader 15 years ago. I always loved him, he guided me throughout college and my 20s. I’m so happy to listen to him every week through this podcast. I still find his opinions and advice incredibly valuable, even when he speaks about subjects that aren’t relevant to me. He talks about sex, but it’s always more than sex. It’s about communication, and that’s what we all get with this wonderful show!	5	Dan Savage is a Treasure	Hdgggggggg
2018-08-15 00:22:07	First time podcast reviewer. I’ve listened to this podcast since 2007. Every week.

2018-08-09 01:56:54	The first 8 minutes are his political agenda. Then there are more commercials than calls. Both the calls and the answers go on FOREVER! I’ve listened to responses that go on for 8 minutes. After listening to 30 episodes I have come to the conclusion that I don’t like his stance on sex. I think his “sex-positive” views actually hurt monogamous relationships. Dan seems uninterested in pursuing this idea that monogamy is the goal for most relationships. The podcast serves the LGBTQ community and straight, but”poly” type relationships. For any straight midwestern types such as myself, you will be made to feel as uptight and conservative as your rich uncle.	1	Here’s the Problem	DickMillerRegrets
2018-07-26 15:40:27	I love this podcast and often recommend it to friends.	5	Smart, grounded, ethical	Cinbadthesailor...
2018-06-30 17:37:11	I'm the one all of my friends come to for sex and relationship advice. Almost all of the advice I give, I've heard from Dan Savage. I love his political rants at the top of the show. He's not always right in his advice, but he's definitely more right than anyone else out there. I live my life by so much of his advice. Thanks, Dan!	5	GGG, ITMFA, Campsite Rule... LOVE IT!!	Yes, THAT Tonya
2018-07-04 04:09:08	I’ve listened to multiple episodes now and every single one is just q&a. Literally not one moment of discussion of the title of the episode (AKA WHAT THAT EPISODE IS ABOUT?!) that’s incredibly misleading. Every episode just says you need to subscribe to get the full episode. How is that ok? I haven’t even heard a full episode to hear it I want to pay them for a subscription. I am an avid podcast listener and have no problem with the concept of patreon campaigns, but don’t like when a podcast not only forces you into it, but deceives you into it. I really like the idea behind this podcast and am very disappointed to take my attention elsewhere.	1	I’m confused by this podcast...	bringitanna
2018-06-19 05:13:43	"After years of listening I basically try to live my life according to:

WHAT WOULD DAN SAVAGE DO?

when I go against that intuition things go wrong for sure

Thank you for sharing your wisdom with us!"	5	Papa Dan	cardboardcupcake13
2018-06-07 18:26:36	My parents started allowing me to listen to Dan Savage when I was in high school, and talked very openly about sex in our household because of his continued advice to be open with your children. Now, a 31 year old woman, I still listen to Dan regularly and get great insight and information to stay informed and not be another uneducated fool. I appreciate his honesty and have really appreciated his advice over the years. I find his advice empowering sometimes and very supportive. Thanks, Dan, Nancy and the Tech Savvy At Risk Teens. Keep up the food work!	5	Lifelong Fan	LoveNotWarTor
2018-06-02 09:28:29	"Interested in people, kinky, a human, gay, or straight. This podcast has something for EVERYONE. Such a positive and funny guy, great guests on the show.

Thanks so much for all the helpful insights Dan!"	5	Here we go again!	Alliecat9
2018-05-22 14:11:15	No one is perfect 100% of the time and I don’t see anything wrong with his introduction rant. Giving advice is a two way street as it can good or bad but depends on how we interpret  it and use it.	5	Opinions Matter & Need to be Aired.	Jordaz2062
2018-05-22 13:32:44	I started reading savage love in ‘03. I’ve been listening to LoveCast since ‘12. I agree with most of Sand advice but honestly listen for the crazy questions-and Dan’s top of show weekly roundup.	5	In love with savage love.	unacompaniedMiner

2018-03-08 15:24:30	I started listening back in 2007, and have enjoyed 11 years of sex education I'd never have gotten as a child growing up in small-town Texas.  Glad this is out there.	5	Sex-Ed for Grownups	usefuljack
2018-04-15 14:56:32	Great show and advice of human interaction being complicated enough so please no more dog advice mixed in with sex advice, these dog people will not stop until it’s all dog talk. Eg, the lady with her dog at the dog park being a dog asking for advice. No more dog talk ever!	4	Please No more dog talk	infin8dvonE
2018-02-17 19:49:17	Dan is best friend you didn’t know you needed in your life until you met him.	5	Amazing	GorditaGuerita
2018-03-07 21:47:21	I commend Dan on his success with this podcast. He has the absolute right to express his opinion on his platform. I’m just surprised and disappointed by his hypocrisy. Come for the GREAT sexual discussion, but know you’ll get a divisive, bigoted and polarizing rant at the beginning of his show. He’d probably be surprised at how progressive and open-minded people who don’t vote for his party are rather than generalizing.	3	I want to like him more	blikhim
2018-03-01 14:09:00	I liked your podcast but now that you are trying to take my second amendment right i can no long listen to you. why take my guns away (when i go target shooting and hunting with them) instead of being a idoit and shoot ppl	1	I will no give my guns up	TFADuke

2018-01-21 18:52:55	I read Savage Love in the Stranger when I lived in downtown Seattle. Now that I'm outside the delivery area, it's nice to have Dan's voice in my ears every week. I enjoy few things more than being indoctrinated by the radical liberal cult of personality :)	5	One Of Us. One Of Us.	RyanVafa
2018-01-30 15:53:50	"If you’re looking for a series of podcast commercials and adverts interspersed with a few seconds-long tidbits of sex and relationship advice, this podcast is for you. It used to be more substantive, but it’s become so bloated with adverts, that Savage’s intro/rant became the big draw for me. However, now with today’s show (Jan 30, 2018), he’s transformed his rant into a groan-worthy comical skit, just like the shallow, sophomoric AM radio morning drive-time shows. 
I wish Savage and his team would just go back to the basics of offering insightful and clever social/political commentary followed by enlightening sex & relationship advice. I understand that adverts have to pay for the show and put some money in Savage & Co’s pockets, but they don’t seem to have any sense that selling off copious amounts of show time to advertisers and staging long, tedious skits just for the sake of making a joke really just cheapen Savage’s good work and brand."	2	Wish They’d Get Back to Basics!	jvollmer57
2018-01-28 05:46:23	Everything's cool with Dan as long as you're not fat and you don't use poppers.....	2	GGG	Oblivion shall own me...
2018-01-28 02:52:56	I like this show, but there are way, way, way too many ads in the micro edition and the only way to avoid them is to subscribe to the much longer magnum edition, which I did for a year because I forgot it was on autopay. The problem with that is he already goes on too long with his answers and an hour is long enough, so why do I want to pay for an hour and a half of this? It's not worth it for me to keep listening if these are my only two choices.	2	Way too many ads	Kath1465
2018-01-14 13:07:03	Dan is responsible for so much of my education and perspective. Whether you already have an open mind or are in desperate need of developing one, this podcast is for you.	5	My favorite podcast.	Gao Shan
2018-01-02 16:09:40	The podcast is a great way to learn about all types of sexuality and expressiveness. Dan savage knows his stuff but also isn't afraid to admit when he isn't sure about something.	5	Love this!	Amy5626
2018-01-01 22:02:06	I discovered Savage love in the back of a printed copy of the onion one day in high school and I've never looked back. Dan and the tech savvy at risk youth showed me there's so much more to be discovered in a relationship than the high school drama I was experiencing and that sometimes I should question my gendered expectations of what a healthy relationship looks like. I've grown so much as a person by listening to this show.	5	Dan is my relationship life coach	SadieWit
2017-12-19 23:45:51	And runs a great show, I’ve been listening for years. Sometimes he goes on and on and makes his point again and again two or maybe four times. But that’s ok, I just zone out, he has a really hot husband.	5	Dan is great	Cableguy1
2017-12-15 14:22:59	I love Dans advice but I honestly love his political rants at the top of each episode. He’s smart, funny and has a soothing angelic voice.	5	Top of the episode = 👌🏽	Vonwolfe

2017-11-28 23:23:08	This podcast is juicy, funny, and insightful.	5	Good Advice	JessyHere
2017-11-06 20:54:09	Savage Love is one of the smartest podcasts around. I love Dan’s opening monologues to each episode, where he breaks down political issues so intelligently and in a way that makes them so digestible. In his answers, he is radically honest, and always tells the caller what they NEED TO HEAR, even if it’s not what they want to hear. Dan has also made me consider the American societal norm of monogamy, and how that isn’t the answer for a lot of people. He’s made me examine my romantic and sexual life in a way that I think will even save future relationships. If I could give this a 6, I would.	5	A highlight of my week	sophianj
2017-11-19 16:02:27	"I’ve grown up with the lovecast, since the days of the iPod, before the commercials, before iPhones were around. I’ve learned much from Dan about human nature. I’ve appreciated the rants on the hypocrisy of political operatives and fundamentalists using religion as a cynical appeal to voters. 

What I can’t get past, however, are the frequent references to God as a non-existent imaginary figure, and blanketing of the real people of faith as somehow ignorant or complicit in the rise of Trumpism. 

Many people of faith are your natural allies in the struggle for social justice, equality, and peace, and against religious fundamentalism, Trumpism, and corporatism. I think Dan has met enough of these people to know that they are out there, and deserve some respect for living their faith."	2	Subscriber since episode one - can’t listen any more!

2017-10-11 12:09:34	I've been following Dan Savage for decades! He is a sharp intellect and a terrific communicator. This podcast is a must listen every Tuesday.	5	Been a fan for decades	sean808080
2017-10-23 00:14:57	I'm relatively new to the gay community and thought this would be a good podcast to learn something, but I was very wrong! It is nothing but a hate-podcast for Trump. I get it you don't like the guy but do you really have to start very podcast like this? You can't honestly say that all of your listeners think exactly like you!	1	Hatecast	1911KC
2017-10-10 10:46:54	I do not agree with all of Dan’s political points as I think they are sometimes driven by emotion instead of facts but I appreciate being exposed to them. I love the sex and relationship advice section and find myself a little excited every Tuesday to get down and dirty with Dan. Most of all I am grateful for a glimpse in to a world I would otherwise have close to zero exposure to.	5	Exposure	PeterBucket
2017-10-02 10:30:17	Dan is terrific and understands the complicated human psychology that underlays human sexuality.  Sometimes I don’t like his vitriolic political positions and hate the same from the other side. But in terms of this podcast I won’t take a star for it. Just a mild heads that if the beginning rant pisses you off or generalizes you/your values into a into a vapid caricature of a less-than-human hate monster who just wants oppress anyone you don’t agree with.....just keep listening for the sex/relationship advice. Thanks for everything you’ve taught me Dan!	5	Best sex/women advice this straight guy ever got.	Michael Moncrief

I lost a lot of really great friends and ""Uncles"". 
I'm a straight male 45, and my home was the stop, on Fri. and Sat. nights, for all my friends to get condoms and astroglide.  
I'm proud of how many lives she effected in her pursuit of education to the young people in school during the AIDS epidemic in Hawaii in the early 90's.

2017-08-18 03:09:42	Dan is a very knowledgeable person who in touch with not only United States society but societies around the world and in the past. I just don't agree with him on some things or when I do I feel like he's being rude about helping someone as if they were an idiot. I don't feel that judgement has any place in therapy or advising, I mean maybe with the criminals that are brought up sometimes.

2017-08-16 19:54:09	For years this has been one of my standby podcasts.

2017-07-31 15:32:06	Dan really has the gift of clarity and insight when seeing to the heart of issues and conflicts, and his directness is refreshing.

2017-07-27 21:38:20	I'm a literal wood hermit who spends a lot of time alone working in the wilderness but when I'm back in the city I can whip out little tidbits of Dan's advice that always seems to jive with those of whom I'm giving it to.

2017-07-16 14:48:46	"To describe Dan Savage as ""no-nonsense"" would be an understatement. His pointed advice based on his decades of experience in the sex advice world is both cutting and kind. Dan's rants at the beginning of the podcast contextualize his philosophies of relationships and sexuality within contemporary social issues. He is a wonderful teacher and the kind of friend who will encourage you to challenge yourself while also telling you when you're being an idiot. 

When his advice becomes contentious he opens dialogue with listeners and reminds us that with a few guiding principals (GGG, Campsite Rule, DTMFA, etc.) we can take care of ourselves."	5	RealArtNerd	RealArtNerd
2017-07-09 11:53:17	I have been listening to Dan Savage and the tech savvy youth for years now. I am not one for writing these reviews, but I kind of have too. They are great and podcast is amazing. Get the magnum for best longer interviews!!!	5	Best Advice!	Erick Suarez

2017-06-18 11:25:14	Dan Savage has been such a huge influence on cultural attitudes towards sex and dating, at least in my circles. I've listened to other advice podcasts, but Dan's is distinguished by how logical and compassionate he is. He has a framework of views from which his advice arises, not just his gut. Also very entertaining. Love the rants.	5	Love it	Kamarall
2017-06-06 10:05:28	I started listening to this podcast recently and it provides useful information on what to say and how to say it in uncomfortable or. new situations. I love this podcast!	5	Informative	Sonja TB
2017-06-15 15:21:58	"I feel his advise to be pretentious, full of ego. like a populist movement, he would say anything for the sake of getting someone to listen and comment just to get attention, never mind that is obscene, inappropriate or sensationalist. he is creating useless melodrama just so he can get some form  of response of any kind. 

Similar to Facebook click bait ads, it's quite hard to tolerate.

I suggest get better podcasts, like this American life, or nytimes modern love. Instead of this pretentious and sensationalist invention."	1	Pretentious sensationalist like a click bait ad	foolish flobberworm
2017-06-07 17:22:16	A man who clearly thinks his status as one minority allows him to ignore his status as a person with privilege in every other aspect of life. He has given some excellent advice but he needs to work on growing his empathy and expanding his worldview.	3	Racist, misogynist, can do better	hagnewsv
2017-06-05 06:55:58	I look forward to every Tuesday because I know Savage Love will be updated. The first 5-10 minutes is usually dedicated to commentary about an important political issue.

2017-04-19 19:03:45	"Perhaps this should be the ""Savage Intolerant of Not-my-beliefs and Also Some Advice Lovecast?""  I used to enjoy this podcast every single week.  I unsubscribed some time ago and check in periodically to see if Dan has stopped opening with political hatred.  It hasn't happened yet.  I muscled through the political propaganda rants for as long as I could to get to the good part of the podcast when he takes calls, answers questions and does what he claims to mean to do in this podcast:  give love and sex advice. I finally gave up when I couldn't stand the political hatred anymore.  Be better than the people you criticize, Dan."	2	Maybe a new title is in order?	Luna Ohio
2017-03-23 02:13:15	"I love Dan. This was the first podcast I ever liked. His advice is honest, (mostly) heartfelt (but not when you ask dumb things), and he's open to talk about annnnny topic touching on relationships or sex. That's what I love about Dan -- he doesn't just take the easy questions. He takes the question about someone with a sneeze fetish and he gives them thoughtful advice about how to incorporate it into their partnered sex life (that's true, he did that).

I've been a subscriber for several years now and I even pay for the magnum version of the podcasts. Worth it!! Keep it up Dan and thank you -- you taught me so much about what I want, what I need, and what I deserve out of a relationship."	5	Love you dan!	Meme143572
2017-04-06 20:30:37	Supposed to be a sex advice podcast but he fancies himself more of a political commentator. Same old rant every day. I agree with his opinions but not what I subscribed for.	2	Signorele wanna be	ItAintAWorkin'
2017-03-22 03:59:30	When schools are not willing to teach students sex positive education, this is the answer we are looking for.

You are changing lives with your show.	5	The education we need!	KaylaJay29
2017-03-08 16:49:44	The first episode I listened to, around 4 years ago, changed my life. Dan has been my go to for advice since. I tell everyone who will listen about how great his show is!	5	Woohoo	marscy
2017-03-14 11:44:42	"I've listened for quite a while, and I'm fed up being insulted by Savage for not aligning with his political authoritarianism. If you're not a mainstream democrat, if your politics speaks to more liberal environmental, labor, and fair trade ethos, you'll have to tolerate being repeatedly and unnecessarily abused by Savage.

I respect myself too much to continue supporting such bullying and immature behavior. I would suggest others do the same until Dan stops this caustic behavior."	2	Disappointed	Å3
2017-03-10 11:21:40	Wow... another militant gay guy. You lose your credibility when you criticize and blame other people for everything. Why can't you promote peace and unity?

2017-02-22 04:54:07	Politics opener + sex talk. Blunt, informative, accepting. Not sure you can get this kind of thing anywhere else. It eventually got redundant for me but definitely worth a listen.	4	Informative and in your face	Lyss Brick
2017-02-10 14:15:32	This was one of the first podcasts I subscribed to, and I'm so glad I did. I've learned so much about sex positivity, relationships, politics, and sexuality as a whole. My mind has been opened to the wide variety of relationships, sexual preferences, gender issues, and dating styles that exist beyond what I already knew. I enjoy Dan's political rants at the beginning of some episodes, and my political involvement has grown because of them. I often binge on old episodes during long drives because no matter how long ago an episode was taped, the conversations are always relevant. I just love this podcast, Dan Savage, Nancy, and the tech-savvy at-risk youth!	5	5 stars	Heathmia
2017-02-16 14:39:03	With nearly half the podcast consisting of political rants, advertisements, interviews, and  political questions/advice being disguised as sex questions/advice, this podcast doesn't leave much for actual love/sex advice. Maybe if I could afford the magnum, I could enjoy what this podcast claims to be.	2	Less politics more sex please!	Justnikki84
2017-02-08 21:02:08	Great mix of practical and emotional advice. I love that Dan actually reads scientific articles, and plays feedback from people who disagree with him.	5	Love it!	FlyGirl333

2017-01-26 19:12:44	I have learned so much about sexuality in general and myself. Please keep up the amazing work!	5	Love it	IC2084
2017-01-26 17:51:42	"Dan is like the sex educator we wish we all had. I've learned so much about sexuality and how to invite more maturity into my relationships. His view on things is often not quite the mainstream, allowing for some lateral movement which I appreciate and learn a lot from. Savage Love started as a joke- and turned into a real advice column once Dan saw that people needed his point of view. (He talks about that in his book.) So that can explain the somewhat ""tough love"" that he gives a lot of the callers, and that he gets some flack for.... That was how it was originally modeled... But hey, sometimes we really need that tough love to move forward on a decision. Check out this podcast if you want to learn more about sexuality, and learn from the relationship struggles others have."	5	Funny and educational	Kw777333999111
2017-01-23 19:55:07	Love listening to Dan's advice on love, family, friends and politics.	5	Great Advice	Aharolds
2017-01-24 21:01:19	I stopped listening when he started chastising Bernie supporters the day after the primaries were over. Best to keep the advice when people ask for it.	3	Getting more and more pompous	Boh @ The Spliff Potcast
2017-01-19 18:20:43	"Long time column reader the podcast is great too
thanks Dan"	5	Great Podcast!	Frank ''D''
2017-01-06 23:00:14	Dan gives excellent relationship and sex advice. He's helping so many people relinquish the unnecessary shame around sex and sexuality that holds people back and makes them feel miserable! Withholding one star because even though I myself am a far-lefty, Dan's liberal self-righteousness is waaay too much sometimes.	4	Great advice!	potteryqueen
2017-01-10 04:04:48	"Thanks to so called ""Experts"" like this idiot, I lost the love of my life.  Pushing the open marriage idea on my wife (she had become a devout listener of Mr Savage's podcasts), destroyed our happiness leaving us both heartbroken and miserable.  I can only hope Karma pays him back in kind someday."	1	Ruined my marriage	lazerbeamhawkins
2016-12-17 16:38:18	Love Dan Savage and I love this podcast. Sometimes funny, sometimes heartbreaking, and everything in between.	5	Love Dan's Perspective	ilea02
2016-12-13 13:44:11	Friends have referenced and recommended Dan Savage for years. I just started listening a few months ago and have learned so much, and been so entertained.	5	A podcast that's GGG	BostonAustinParis
2016-12-12 21:13:06	Dan, I started off reading your column many years ago, and then found your books, and then your podcast. I thoroughly enjoy your no nonsense style, and I feel that your advice is almost always right on point! My wife and I credit our ability to talk frankly and openly about sex & our relationship largely to your podcast - it's given us both a shared vocabulary and framework! Also, I personally credit your podcast (well, the Hump! film fest actually) with playing a big part in our relationship - you helped me to propose to her at the DC show in Spring of '14, and we've been happily married since 9/6/14! Thanks for the inspiration, the laughs, and the learning. Keep it up!	5	My OG favorite podcast	Sunshinegrrly
2016-12-07 02:12:36	If you are right wing, religious, sexually repressed person, this may not be the podcast to  your liking.  But if you are a grown adult straight, gay or something in between, this show offers non filtered, open discussion sex & love related topics.  Highly recommended.  Thanks.	5	Not your mom's playlist	Ventureheat
2016-12-07 16:42:08	The love part of this podcast is cool, IF you can make it that far. I cannot to listen to another biased incredibly small minded and poorly informed rant at the beginning. You sound so whiney, ignorant, arrogant and pig headed that I have actually grown to strongly dislike listening to the sound of your voice. Stick to what you're good at and what this podcast is supposed to be about.  By the time the love advice comes on you're down to 10 minutes before it ends. Not worth my time to FF through all the BS.	1	Unsubscribed after a year	Bbvgakalsfdskskd
2016-11-29 23:16:20	This is one of my favorite podcasts. Dan, though very passionate and opinionated is great at what he does. He gives advice to people of all walks of life and does so with class as he respects the points of view and opinions that differ from his own. I've learned a lot while listening to this podcast.	5	Entertaining, Civil Advice	WillGibbonsDesign
2016-11-27 07:19:48	I love Dan's perspective on not only relationship/sex problems his callers have, but on social justice and LGBT rights issues. I always come away feeling better for having listened to Dan's advice, even if I can't really relate to the original calls. I just wish the micro-version didn't have SO many ads and that the magnum were downloadable so I can bring it to work where I have no signal.	5	Great advice, hilarious show.	ManyLeggies
2016-11-18 03:45:00	He's always on point with his advice, and I appreciate hearing about his thoughts on politics and activism.	5	Dan's the best.	English teacher24
2016-11-23 04:58:50	"I could not stand to listen to this hateful man attacking the democratic process, and his newly elected president.
What a horrible sentiment, stirring up hatred towards others. 
The election process is similar in the UK, with the popular vote not counting towards electing a leader. 
Parliament is decided upon seats won. Get your facts straight, first, then maybe share some love.
Bottom line is: you LOST. Now, get over it, and stop all the drama."	1	hatemonger?	dhoddl
2016-11-18 01:04:27	I love dan! I love how the show starts off with a hot topic. I love his real advice. I always predict how I think he will answer. Sometimes I'm right. I want to train my brain to think like his! He is awesome!	5	Best advice ever	Piper1549
2016-11-17 03:56:00	"A certain number of hours of listening to Savage should be required before anyone is allowed to date. Even if you can do it doesn't mean you're equipped to do so responsibly. I've worked in the sexual education and health industry, and this person would be one of my ""last supper with any dead or alive"" people. Thank you to all that put this in the world."	5	Should be a drivers test equip for dating	TaytoBean
2016-11-15 17:35:26	I started reading Savage Love in 2000 and thought it was one of the best column I'd ever read. The Lovecast was the first and for a long time, the only podcast I listened to and again I found Dan really struck a chord. Dan seems like a friend and I look forward every week to listening. Thanks Dan!	5	Like a friend	ToddMyers
2016-11-04 10:10:00	I started reading this in the village voice years ago, so glad this podcast popped up because I was missing my Dan savage fix, as a young woman I have found this podcast to be formative and although I've always considered myself pretty liberal but there was room for improvement and Dan always let me know. Thank you	5	Life changing	Beca Acosta

2016-10-27 02:23:47	I listen to this podcast religiously! I tune in every single Tuesday and have heard every single episode. This podcast has really given me so much more perspective on sexuality and relationships. I'm grateful to Dan Savage for the work he does!	5	My favorite!	MissouriBelle
2016-10-22 14:10:30	"Long time listener to the Podcast! I really enjoy this podcast, there are times I cringe for things that counter my ""babygay"" world views and slowly I find myself understanding my on queer sexuality more and the options that are out there that don't necessarily fit the string/hetero macro culture! GGG! Thanks Dan!"	5	This podcast spreads my... mind?	stephnzmh
2016-10-19 17:57:08	All my life I have been GGG, but never knew it.  Although I live in pretty liberal area and have lots of friends across the gender/sexuality/spectrum, I still feel such a sense of community every time I listen to an episode. Sometimes, I listen to get clarity on my own issues. Other times, it is to just distract myself with the problems of others. Most of all, I just feel like a more empathic human being after I included this show into my daily life. I appreciate Dan's honesty. Can he be problematic at times? Sure, but all your faves are (someone else should link the tumblr page for me). He is real, and that is what you want from someone who is giving meaningful advice. Keep it up Dan and the Tech Savy At Risk Youth!!!! Oh and PS.... I love your often political rants at the beginning of the show.	5	changed my life	SylviaVT
2016-10-15 17:55:05	Really appreciate Dan bringing in alternative lifestyle options into the mix. I've really valued the way he can break apart a situation, in a light I have yet to look at it from. Also, I tune into his morning rants religiously. Way more than the advice even. His Blabbermouth podcast is great too	5	Great rants before advice and really nice alternative perspective on situations	MASdestruction
2016-10-13 01:35:57	Dan Savage amazingly simplifies and clarifies pretty much everything sex, gender, relationship, and pretty much everything. Plus, the podcast is super-fun!	5	Long time listener	AJPeppa

2016-09-15 23:13:26	This podcast has literally changed so many of my attitudes on so many issues. I love the advice you give and also how you put yourself on blast at the end by playing even the unfavorable call backs. Your rant on third party candidates was out of this world!	5	Best Advice Ever!

2016-09-14 02:50:31	Thank you Dan Savage for this amazing podcast	5	Amazing podcast!!	Caffinegirl
2016-09-12 07:09:16	I love Dan Savage's frank, empathetic and humorous take on the many vagaries of sex and relationships, but I'll be honest, what keeps me coming back are the rants at the top of the show, when Dan gives his blistering take on the social and political issues of the day. Don't let anybody tell you it doesn't belong here... sex is very much an issue in politics and society, and I love hearing it.	5	Sex + Social Commentary = The Best	MaxLarch
2016-09-06 15:13:10	Dan Savage has been around the block - and he shares what he knows - tone is very entertaining and fun - he gently teases often times without being mean - very refreshing perspectives - brings great positive sex positive education. One bone to pick - his rants on politics, while great, sometimes get long winded....	5	A Classic	Brtyu7775457
2016-08-29 16:35:25	Savage, enjoy it!!	5	Savage!	VictorTheVicious
2016-08-23 11:57:30	I am a straight guy, I have been listening to this podcast for five years, and I find it to be one of the only venues where issues of sex and sexuality are handled with the highest level of care and integrity. Dan Savage is wonderful. I would say I agree with him about 70% of the time, but in the areas where I disagree, it is still totally clear to me that he has the best interests of all people in mind, which makes a big difference. Thanks to the savage love cast team for everything you do. You make a big difference in so many of our lives, including mine.	5	Invaluable	Mozayik x
2016-08-16 11:11:16	Great host who is passionate about the topics. I've learned quite a bit from this show. Deals with quite a bit of lgbt issues but as a straight male I constantly find it informative and interesting.	5	The best sex and relationship podcast	End reviewer 377337
2016-08-18 13:36:39	Some of the advice Dan gives is just wrong. A woman called in asking about how to deal with what sounded like an emotionally and verbally abusive boyfriend. Dan didn't pick up on any of the red flags and encouraged her to approach communication differently. Another listener asked about how to deal with guilt from a break up. He invalidated what she was feeling and told to basically kiss off. If you want better relationship advice, seek out the dear sugar columns and a good therapist.	2	Shaky advice at best	heartportomuito
2016-08-10 03:39:24	I honestly don't recall how I came across this podcast. I listened for a while and then when I got too occupied, I unsubscribed. Then I realized I missed it too much. This is podcast is totally out of the ordinary for me, but I enjoy it immensely. I may not always agree with Dan, but the commentary is absolutely necessary. Worth the listen.	5	Unexpected favorite	MotionSustained
2016-07-24 17:31:55	Always look forward to Tuesday mornings.	5	Consistently excellent	Annelise4
2016-07-11 04:09:34	Dan brings a clear moral vision to the topics.  Plus, he gives good advice.	5	a voice of reason	jashenmiller

2016-07-05 15:37:29	The Savage Lovecast never fails to make me smile. Dan's advice, no matter how crude, is always honest and always on point. Job well done, Mr. Savage and the Tech Savvy at Risk Youth!	5	Awesome	Rasela85

2016-06-30 03:08:50	This podcast is one of the biggest reasons I am who I am. Polyamorous, happily in multiple relationships, married to the most amazing woman, and an LGBTQ Activist.	5	Dan Savage is amazing.	TheThrapture
2016-06-30 13:31:56	For a podcast that talks about the vast differences in the relationship world, the host is completely ignorant and small minded.	1	Small Minded	Ryan's stuff
2016-06-24 02:30:52	Dan's podcast has changed my life. I have been struggling to come out about falling in love with a woman, and the support of strangers has been crucial. Dan has opened my mind on many sexual fronts and I'm so grateful.	5	Hope and joy	Squidinkletters
2016-06-28 15:13:26	"I'd say I'm middle of the road politically, and lean to the left on social issues. However Dan is rambling about how bad the second amendment and the stats he uses are completely false, not a SINGLE PERSON can go into a gun shop and purchase a AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. You CAN NOT DO THAT. There are several points in the previous love cast where he just spews out ignorance and people should understand regardless of political party regardless of social views, guns are not the problem. Should we ban cars because they kill more than terrorist attacks, homicides, and other related gun deaths? Should we ban airplanes for how lethal they are because they've killed 1000s of people? Should we ban religion because radicals in the religions kill people? You get my point?

I am not a republican or democrat, I do not support Trump or Clinton. However anyone read this please read what exactly the second amendment is and why do we need it.

Also last point, your debate against the gun owner made you look childish, simple as that. You couldn't rebuttal properly so you decided to just keep calling him wrong or straw manning him. Even though we disagree politically over the course of the year I still respected you, until now. Pathetic..."	1	Ignorant about the second amendment	Texasryano

2016-06-06 13:48:31	I have read this column since I was 14 and now at thirty I still love Dan. He gives honest advice and asked experts if he isn't sure. I think him for helping me to keep and open mind and strive for heathy relationships.	5	Wonderful	Tikimia9
2016-06-03 20:39:05	Dan is fantastic and so refreshing. I love the phone calls and the advice he gives. I am always surprised what he is going to say! This podcast has opened me up sexually and I hope it can help others who are unable to talk openly about sex learn some new things. Great work.	5	Dan is the man	Ericahille
2016-05-24 11:52:36	He helps me keep an open mind with sex and relationships. Even if you think you know everything about sex and relationships you will learn more listening to this week after week.	5	I love Dan's advice!	ZucchiniNutMuffin

2016-05-14 03:28:21	I usually find Dan's advice to be spot-on. He's honest -sometimes brutally so-in a cruel-to-be-kind sort of way. The sexual aspect of the podcast is interesting, but secondary to me. I really love hearing people's stories.  As a result of  finding out about alternatives to monogamy, I'm now a married woman in a monogamish relationship and couldn't be happier. No way would I have explored this option without Dan's guidance.	5	Eye Opening	Suki424

2016-05-02 00:30:44	So glad I started listening to this.  Been listening 1yr now.  It made me so thankful for my relationship with my husband.  I stopped questioning stupid things and start telling him more how much I appreciate him and our communication. Thanks Dan!	5	Thank you!!	Thankfulk80
2016-05-07 10:31:28	I have not been listening long, but it must be long enough.  I am hearing the same things over and over.  I found myself making sure I hadn't restarted an episode.	1	We get it.	armybrat1872

2016-04-20 09:20:57	"Best present ever! The answer to ""What is the best lube for pegging?"" Prefferably mysogynist tears but they don't bottle that.

2016-04-07 17:45:45	For a quick update on the political scene on lgbt and women rights news, listen to the first few minutes... I still listen to the jingle and sing along. Whenever I need to justify or explain my stance on my sexuality and relationship, I quote Dan. Listen to his podcast and you too, will sound smart 👍	5	Love the rants	Simone907
2016-04-05 04:11:36	The advice Savage gives is usually from a self-serving place. His viewpoints rarely transcend his privilege, and he is more than presumptuous.	1	ugh	jacketpockets
2016-03-23 23:56:37	"I love that Dan is so clear and direct about his politics and has such well-thought and knowledgeable point of view.  Worth listening to for the rants and politics!
And the advice is so right on. Whatever the wacky topic or kink you’re into, it usually comes down to communicating more--the magic for any of our relationships. Use your words!  
I wish there were more people over 40 asking questions about mature relationships."	5	Wish I could hang out with Dan!	toasted4

2016-03-09 17:51:18	Originally a column reader, now long time listener, not-yet caller (though happy he’s always there for me if I need him.) Dan’s the man, from the rants in the very beginning to the “and we’ll leave it there” at the end.	5	The GGG pod	powwwj
2016-03-09 05:36:39	This podcast is extremely educational. It really sparked my interest in sociology. He gives great straight forward advice I always end up giving to a friend in need.	5	What would Dan Savage do?	Xokati
2016-03-03 18:43:42	This podcast has taught me so much, and always keeps me grounded. The only advice show I listen to--no one compares to Dan	5	I love you, Dan!	Maggie192
2016-03-02 21:10:21	At the beginning of the show I like hearing Dan's opinions even if I don't always agree with them. It makes me feel in the loop with some current events. Also the sex/relationship advice is invaluable. I get something out of every episode.	5	Very informative	dezchevy
2016-02-24 08:42:00	Brilliance!  Dan is the man. Absolutely opens a different perspective on relationship advice!	5	Amazeballs!	Crazybird..

2016-02-18 19:19:22	My discovery of this podcast occurred when looking for something to listen to when moving across the country. I proceeded to catch up on over a year's worth of episodes. I've been a loyal listener ever since. Hopefully once I'm out of school next spring I can afford to subscribe to the magnum edition.	5	The one podcast that never drops from my weekly rotation	JMPC-2004
2016-02-14 04:47:57	I have a long commute to work and Dan is definitely in my rotation! Even though my sex life is basically nonexistent right now, I still think the advice is relevant enough that maybe I'll learn something useful for in the future.I know a lot of people don't like the rants, but they don't bother me so much and it seems most of the podcast I listen to involve ranting. I think I'm into it. Keep doing what you're doing Dan, I look forward to hearing your voice every week!	5	One of my favorite podcast!	Kmb12345678890
2016-01-31 04:03:41	Dan has always been awesome giving advice.  He still is.  He will be forever.	5	The original, and still the best	ShaunTK
2016-02-05 16:35:48	"I understand he's trying to make a living, but I feel like there are multiple commercials between every call, not to mention he has a PAY version of the podcast whose contents are often listed as the contents of the free version. Also, the answer to each call is about twice as long as it needs to be, as he repeats himself over and over. The advice is great, however, and has opened my eyes and recalibrate do my sense of ""normal."""	3	Too many commercials and too repetitive.	mjdodd
2016-01-27 18:19:53	I can't get enough of this podcast. Love Dan's rants and his advice. I've been a listener for a few years now and am jealous of my husbands magnum subscription. I am certainly a better person and better in my relationships from listening.	5	Love it	Sarah Pierson

2015-12-15 15:48:37	The content of the show is generally informative and sometimes funny, but there's too much opinionated political talk at the beginning of the most recent episodes.

2015-11-22 01:34:16	These conversations are the ones you can’t have on TV, radio or anywhere else. Well, sure you COULD, but not with the compassion and clarity of Dan’s point of view. I agree with him 90% of the time, but listening to this has improved my own relationship.	5	Good dialogue	sideburnspower
2015-11-21 16:19:09	Dan is directly responsible for a very new way of being in the world: GGG, crystal clear about consent, leaving people better than you found them, managing jealousy with kindness but not letting it control, and an assumption that sex is vital rather than optional. These things have changed my life and the lives of so many that I know. I also believe he is a kind of relationship prophet who is ushering in a time where non-monogamy is FINE, rather than shameful. If you can open your mind and allow the time it takes to listen to years of advice, you will be a different person by the end.	5	Changing sex lives, one rant at a time	Cosettemarie
2015-11-03 05:29:31	With help from the Tech-Savvy-At-Risk-Youth, Dan delivers sound, inclusive advice worth paying attention to. Consistently entertaining, educational and insightful. Wish it was The Daily Savage Lovecast.	5	Octopus!!!!!!!!	Cycle Billy

2015-10-17 17:26:03	So, that was a bit so impressive tribute to Amy Grant, but it's true that every Tuesday I wake up happy knowing that another magnum edition of Savage Lovecast is available. Dan is funny, smart, and willing to change his mind as he hears different perspectives. He encourages people to make the life that works for them outside be common boundaries society strings up around us. All the while he does so without dismissing folks who approach life in a more traditional manner.	5	Every Tuesday There's Your Name...	CarpeDiFemme
2015-10-08 05:48:21	"I look forward to every Tuesday when Savage Lovecast is downloaded. Not only do I love Dan's raw, honest advice, but his articulate, thought-provoking, and brutally real commentary on current affairs forces me to dig deeper into my own opinions. Thank you, Dan, for making me laugh, cringe, choke-up and scream ""yeah!"" from my car as I listen to you on my drives."	5	My favorite part of the week	Aesthetic
2015-10-04 18:08:56	I think our country would be a whole lot happier and healthier if more people would subscribe to this podcast. I've recommended it to my teenagers and my parents, and I think sex ed in schools should take this non-judgmental approach.	5	Informative and interesting!	penguinmaster
2015-09-30 14:20:50	Dans great.	5	Educational ;)	Bramblebee5
2015-09-28 04:40:43	We see so much propaganda about what love and marriage are supposed to be. Dan, thank you so much for opening things up a little and teaching us that there are so many ways to love and be loved. I feel so much more compassion for others and I feel like I really have the tools to be truly understanding and supportive of my partner in a way I've always wanted to be. And I also feel like I have the tools to stand up for myself if and when I need to. I don't always agree with your advice, but that's part of the fun of thinking critically about all of this, right? :) thank you for being such a strong voice in this area - we need it.	5	I Lovecast It :)	reeesm
2015-09-25 03:24:23	If you aren't listening to Dan Savage, you're doing it wrong.	5	Just do it	Msmel1979
2015-09-17 00:44:31	Thank You for all your advice, humor and seriousness. We appreciate how you approach subjects and tell it how it is. We also like when you bring in an expert or someone with direct knowledge of the subject at hand. We love you! Wishing you everything fabulous😃❤️	5	Raw and honest!	Seana Magnano
2015-09-08 19:29:55	"Dear Dan and Tech-Savvy-At-Risk-Youth,

For a number of years, listening to both your weekly podcast as well as digging into the archives has motivated me to grab my iPod and head out the door for a hike or run. I absolutely love the political rants, and I’m really looking forward to listening this next year as the presidential race gets underway. A big thank you for all the fun-filled runs and distraction from my burning calves.

Love,

A happy tramper from the San Juans"	5	This podcast keeps me from being a couch potato	542 roadtrip
2015-09-15 16:00:58	"The sanctimonious preaching is really starting to ramp up. Looks like it’s time to wait until after the election cycle in in the states is through. At the end of the day this is really a 30 minute podcast, with constant commercials, and plugging for the paid version. Skip to 13:08 if you want to hear the actual podcast.

And this is coming from a liberal, stable career holding, gay adult male, in a loving relationship. I’m not some tea party conservative, just someone who feels that Dan Savage has reached the point where his own preaching and pushing of world views is becoming as bad (if not worse) than the conservatives he claims to be working against."	1	Episode 464 | Skip to 13:08	SnowHawkMike
2015-09-08 20:55:30	Dan's advice is straightforward, funny, and often enlightening. It's great to have a venue to listen in on conversations like this without pearl-clutchers standing around and crying about the children being corrupted blah blah blah. Anyway, overall it is terrific but I had to take it down a half star because (1) sometimes you can tell Dan didn't really listen very carefully to the questions presented by the callers, and is answering what he wants to rant about/make assumptions about instead; and (2) when he gets going on his socio-political rants at the beginning (which I generally love) he sometimes gets into legal topics and you can tell he has close to no clue how the law works and what the applicable doctrines are (yes I am a lawyer). I hope no one is trying to gain an understanding of current American jurisprudence via Dan Savage! Those are relatively minor issues though.	4	Four and a half stars	TaliesinGirl
2015-09-06 18:43:31	An incredibly inclusive podcast to people of all genders and orientations - this has been an incredibly educational podcast. Dan has very sound and realistic advice, and even if I don't agree with every piece of advice he has to give, it has broadened my mind and become more empathetic towards differing romantic and sexual situations. To those who take issue with the poscast being 'too gay', you need to get with the times and evolve, the podcast's callers are simply diverse because we live in a sexually diverse world. I'm impressed with the number of resources he has at hand, how well-educated he is, and I'm pleased by the humor, I'm glad there is frank talk and zero sex shaming.	5	Love the Lovecast!	loonylinsey
2015-09-02 20:39:06	this is a great podcast which is why I’m giving it 5 stars but Dan uses the term “unpack” WAY TOO MUCH.	5	no more unpacking.	MilkMan27
2015-08-31 05:42:44	"I laugh at least once an episode, but my heart is often touched by Dan's callers and his compassionate response to them.  Love the Tech Savy At Risk Youth and Nancy as well!

Dan, never stop ranting!"	5	Moving and hilarious.	UWPodcastGuy
2015-08-26 13:52:50	Dan provides rational advice that has given me a healthier outlook on relationships, both romantic & platonic. He doesn't hesitate to bring in an expert when he knows someone else who can provide better advice, which I really appreciate & respect.	5	Improved My Outlook	LNJ47
2015-08-01 16:07:50	People are so honest with Dan, and his advice is nearly always open-minded, useful, entertaining, and occasionally savage! This podcast allows its audience insight into so many people's pleasures and pains; if you listen, you can't help but become a more compassionate, informed, and well-rounded person.	5	Dan Savage for president	heavilybutteredpopcorn
2015-08-22 04:13:45	I really like listening to this podcast as it helps me to be open minded and to hear different perspectives.  Dan is a white gay man, and that definitely comes through, so I hear the people of color and people of other marginalized identities who complain about him... I'd love for him to be more inclusive in his language and bring more people of color on to the show, but it's still a good podcast to listen to.  And I hardly pay attention to politics so it's good to be a little informed by him.	4	Great for broadening your mind	Csmochilera
2015-07-20 06:16:25	"I've been a Magnum subscriber since the beginning and you should be one too. Some people complain about the rant at the top of the show, but that's my favorite part every week. I also love the segment ""What You Got?"""	5	love it	JazzGomez
2015-07-26 05:13:26	Very helpful! Thanks!	4	Great Show!	Naughty Student
2015-07-14 16:34:32	Been listening since the beginning, Dan still finds ways to answer the occasionally repeating questions.  The guests are always very interesting.  The X-Mas special this past year was painfully funny.  Dan is helping us all with this podcast.	5	Still great	Andrew Bohrer
2015-07-11 20:02:54	"I been listening since the beginning when the opening theme was that weird marching band music. I love the “new” theme song, but I have a fondness for that old weird one.

I pay for the Magnum addition and this is one of my can’t-miss podcasts every week. Always entertaining and often enlightening.

I’ve heard lots of people criticize Dan for his supposed slights to lesbians, bisexuals, etc, but I have found his commentary and guest choice to always be balanced and reasonable."	5	I like it Magnum style	Taylor Tublett
2015-07-02 17:04:46	I've been listening to Dan's podcast for several weeks now, and I have to say, I'm very impressed by the advice he gives to callers. He comes across as a very genuine and honest guy, and the wisdom he gives on relationship advice is often times very relatable and helpful. Not only does he offer relationship advice, but also talks about politics as well, which I typically find to be educationally refreshing. It feels really good being able to put into practice a lot of Dan's advice in my own relationship, and I have to say, it's made us a lot happier. Thank you, Dan, for this amazing podcast. I'm always eagerly looking forward to next week!	5	Improved My Relationship!	AppDude27

2015-06-23 23:36:55	I've read savage's column and loved it. The podcast was a colossal let down. Maybe he is more thoughtful in his writing? Either way, I couldn't stomach 5 minutes of his soap boxing. The equivalent would be if I assumed everything I read gay men tweet was true of all gay men, and then went on a rant about how wrong all gay men are.	1	Another white privileged guy inserting his take on lesbians	Why pay?

2015-06-10 15:41:34	Warning! Sex advice columnist Dan Savage’s podcast is not safe for work! Savage has been in the game for many, many years and will not beat around the bush to get you on the right track. This podcast is all listener calls, and I love the old school vibe of a caller on the line getting advice from a sex columnist.  The majority of the calls are voicemails but Savage will pick one caller per show to call back live to get more information and give them advice on the spot. Although openly gay and in a 20 year relationship with Husband Terry (who is often mentioned), Dan Savage does not discriminate on topics to weigh in on; gay, straight, trans, swingers, recently divorced, age gap (excluding, of course pedophelia!) coming out of the closet and much more. I’m always so impressed at how direct and quality his advice in within such a short show but he has definitely put his time in!	5	Savage Knows Best	MundizzleDazzle
2015-04-16 22:18:58	I’ve been listening for 6 years now (and a magnum subscriber)……this podcast has changed my life in a million ways. I didn’t even know I was gay until I started listening to this podcast every week. Crazy, but true. Maybe this podcast turns you gay? Dan is great, I use his advice for all my friends when they got love drama….I’ve even met him in person! Obsessed with how much I love this show and all the good it’s doing for the world.	5	THE BEST!!!	B.B. Gunn_

2015-01-16 22:49:14	Checked it out at the advice of a 20-something friend and was not impressed. Gratuitous use of explicit language for no other reason than to gain street cred with a young audience. And trust me, I've got no problem using and being around such language myself when the emotional context supports doing so, but his tone of voice doesn't seem to warrant the language choice, and it sounds like he's just trying to be cool.	1	Not impressed	Chaux girl
2014-12-27 04:33:25	Dan is so many things: smart, funny, insightful, and a great communicator. It surprises me how diverse every episode is despite the main topic always being sex. The guests are scattered but always relevant, and Dan always pushes the envelope with every episode. It's an hour I love listening to every week!	5	One of my favorites!	Junior G.
2015-01-10 04:02:04	"Great right up to 426 – then, WOW! Really Gus, you dedicate an episode to making fun of Christens because  -as that so called Comic claims: Christens don’t retaliate. I am deeply offended. 

I did wait to see if the joke would somehow sink in or, maybe, time would somehow erase my disappointment with someone that I used to hold in somewhat high regard but sadly I could not and cannot and - will not! Therefore, laugh all you want at my miserable retaliatory effort but I had to do something after your exploit into Christen bashing. 

I have deleted your podcast in retaliation for defiling Christ.  Hopefully, all Christens will respond in kind to terminate your broadcast for this sin."	1	Time is up  - 426	Maximiilian

2014-06-23 05:07:14	This is by far the best advise podcast on sex and relationships. Dan always gives very honest and practical advice.	5	Great podcast	dhill00
2014-09-06 01:57:43	I love the goal of this podcast to promote acceptance and openness towards all forms of sexuality but I hate Dan as a host. For being so open-minded in regards to sex he is beyond closed-minded, presumptuous and unabashedly rude towards anyone remotely religious or conservative. I’d rather listen to someone who’s not such hypocrite for not accepting those people who aren’t very left-winged, non-religious, and cynical.	2	Good Topics, Obnoxious and Rude Host	Don't wanna be a fish anymore

2014-08-05 03:30:12	All humans will benefit from the honesty of Dan Savage.  I couldn't agree with myself more.  Now and again Dan will repeat himself himself, but it only an assurance that the most important gleaming nuggets of Dan's rich philosophy be pulled directly from the etched stone of his philosopher's stone tablet. He’s the best, guys.	4	A MUST for every human.	S. Slaughter
2014-06-19 08:29:07	Dan Savage will open your mind in the best, most entertaining way possible. His podcast has changed my life and made my sex life rockin'! Straight, gay, bi, single, married, monogamous, poly, this podcast acknowledges and appeals to everyone. If you plan on having any sort of sex at all ever again, do yourself the biggest favor ever and listen to this highly entertaining podcast!	5	Dan Savage is awesome! Brilliant podcast!	Callicopia
2014-06-09 17:38:53	Where to start? Dan does an excellent job offering advice and an amusing time giving rants. As one of those bigoted, right-wing, Christian types, I think more Christians should listen to this podcast in order to gain an insight into the LGBT community and to better understand their mindsets. Plus, it helps to know what the other side is saying and why. While some of the content is extreme, much of the content is pretty decent and his advice is very similar to that of therapists and pastors. Having listened for over four years, I definitely repeat Dan’s mantra and theme of communication to any of my friends who come to me advice. It is something I think he does a great job repeating every episode and one that more people need to hear, because in any relationship, whether hook-up or long-term, communication is what matters and is what is key for its survival.	5	Great job Dan!	Izorian
2014-06-05 18:55:14	"I look forward to this podcast every single week. Dan is hilarious and whitty. I love the questions he gets and I enjoy hearing his responses. It's always entertaining.

At the top of each podcast he does a ""rant"" because there's no shortage of stuff to rant on in this twisted world. I sincerely enjoy hearing his perspective on world news. He even brings up things that I haven't stumbled upon through other news sources. Typically he's calling to task some bigoted politician or whatever, but he really makes you think. I hope that you give the podcast a listen if you haven't done so already!"	5	Best Podcast I Listen To!!	WeasWeas
2014-05-24 15:58:55	I could listen all day.	5	Amazeballs	Yelowkiwi
2014-05-14 12:29:37	Savage Lovecast is fantastic every week, and if you're like me, you get sad once they start playing the comments sent in about previous shows because that means the episode is almost over. If you're like me, you ought to subscribe to the Magnum podcast. It's pretty cheap (I do the $5 per month route, though if you pay more upfront you can save some cash) and it's more of what makes the Lovecast so amazing. I've been listening to the entire backlog of Magnum episodes, even though I've already heard the micro versions of most of them. I thought it would be repetitive, but I was wrong. I've enjoyed hearing some stuff I've heard before, and the new content is great. Not only are there more calls, there appears to be more long-form content like interviews and such. The point is Magnum rocks, so do it.	5	One of the best shows -- go Magnum!	LoganCMD
2014-05-14 18:22:12	I'm a new listener, and I can't get over how many sponsors and ads there were. Between every question he answered he talked about another sponsor. Within 20 mins I heard at least 3-4 of them. Podcasts are a different format from television and should be treated as such. Give an intro with sponsors at the beginning, or have a break in the middle, but not every 5 minutes. Too much. I won't be listening.	2	Lots of advertisements	Timultuoustimes
2014-05-13 13:33:08	Love to hear the different things that people are struggling with and gives me some perspective on my own issues.	5	Great podcast	Jagcs
2014-05-10 00:49:46	Not only in regards to sex, but as a human being. Dan each weeks teaches me and I am happy to study at the feet of such brilliance. You should be listening.	5	I am a better person for listening to this show	TAYREL713
2014-05-09 16:17:55	Let Dan Savage be your Jimmeny Cricket. His podcast has excellent insight and good humor.  I recommend this highly to all my friends.  Listening helped me abolish my homophobia. Thanks, Dan!	5	Savage truth	D20chick
2014-04-12 00:31:09	As good as it gets.	5	Fun and informative	Philoktitis_CA
2014-04-13 12:22:58	Love this podcast! I was already a big fan of her standup, writing, and TV, but I didn't know about girl on guy until I heard her guest appearance on the champs podcast. The only reason she doesn't get 5 stars is the long and winding prologues and epilogues. Girl, just stop. Gimme your dates, a quick life update, and a brief intro to your guest. I'm already listening at this point; let the guest win me over (or not) themselves. Thanks! I will keep listening even if I just fast forward the first five minutes.	4	Can't enough Aisha, except...	Ariginalgangsta
2014-03-26 12:15:18	I love Dan. He puts stuff in a wonderful no nonsense perspective that I enjoy to listen to and I have found myself quoting him on more than one occasion.	5	Best possible podcast!	Rusty91185
2014-02-28 05:25:49	Should be in the top 10 podcasts	5	Dan is the man	Tall Nice Guy 69
2014-03-15 20:29:47	I do love your show.  I think it's especially awesome that you put up sound bites of people who disagree with you.  However I think that sometimes, you Dan Savage come off as overly narcissistic.  Everyone needs a critic who cares.  I hope you can take it in that spirit.	4	Good but...	JUNKEDNSTOREEZ
2014-03-02 21:58:41	A little bit of Dan goes a long way. His callers often should be referred into therapy(i.e. his unicorn callers) but anything goes with monogamish Dan else you're slut shamming and/or not sex positive. Further Dan is not a doctor and often says things that should be discussed with a doctor. I deleted the podcast after a month. Classic Loveline was far better.	2	Unimpressed	Sargon20
2013-11-12 03:52:47	Sad though that he only calls back gay boys in closet these days.	5	Hero	BJ Slater
2014-02-23 02:20:32	I wanted to like this show. I promise. But, to me, it sometimes feels like Dan is more concerned with concoting memes and forming a cult of personality than he is with answering questions in a concise and helpful manner. He tends to ramble on and repeat himself. I love the frank way he approaches sexual matters but in the end it's just... meh.	3	It's OK	balraznor
2014-01-31 07:25:53	I listened to several episodes and found it quite entertaining. Dan is smart and extremely articulate, and he brings a lot of wisdom to his answers. However, I didn't like the way he sometimes belittles, berates, or otherwise trashes some callers, without regard to their feelings or the genuineness of their questions. In other cases Dan is extremely sensitive to people's emotions, but there are some people he doesn't like, and it's sad to hear him verbally abuse them. Eventually I decided I couldn't continue to listen to the negative comments and unsubscribed from the podcast.	2	Entertaining but too mean	Inter Relations
2014-01-15 20:10:48	I only wish lesbian sex and relationships were discussed more frequently. I usually support Dan's advice to any given caller and appreciate that he plays dissenting opinions when they are called in. While he may not be perfect (who is?) I abosultely think this podcast does more to help than harm.	4	Almost perfect	NCladyfan
2014-01-12 03:17:21	I've been listening to the Savage Lovecast for years and I always find it interesting. I would say I agree with Dan's advice about three fourths of the time. Sometimes he is rude, oversimplifies, or provides advice that is unrealistic or in topics that he is not qualified to address, so take what he says with a grain of salt. However, I think he does the world a service in that he embraces and promotes sex positivity, and makes people feel normal about their quirks. I think he's done a lot of good in promoting people coming out (when it's safe for them to) and challenging the idea that monogamy is for everyone. I also like that he's pretty open to criticism, as he often plays calls from people that disagree with him. It's definitely worth a listen.	4	A very engaging podcast, with a few flaws	Masha0306
2013-12-30 08:38:02	But, please tell me what college have you ever gone to?  I agree and understand some of your opinions.  You have to realize the following you have and get some education.  It is apparent that you positively encourage people but I just encourage you to keep it full of knowledege too.	3	Love to Listen	Ficrab
2013-10-22 11:56:59	I might be the biggest Savage Lovecast fan ever, I listened to every episode at least two or three times over the years, and go to sleep every night listening to the golden oldies.  Naturally I leaped at the change to get even more when the Magnum version came out, but instead of twice as many questions, as I wished for, I got a few more questions and a lot more ranting and pseudo-science (plus interviews).  The ads in the regular version never bothered me, and I am big podcast ad hater for other ones, and ~$40 a year seems a little steep for a few extra questions and lots of bad science (I am a biologist) but I can't stand the thought of missing anything.	5	Biggest Savage Lovecast fan ever… the Magnum Version not so much	ZedEm
2013-09-28 17:11:12	I've always enjoyed reading Savage Love, so it's great to be able to listen to it too. Dan's rants are fantastic!	5	More reasons to love Dan Savage	andtheargonauts
2013-09-23 04:51:53	Dan nails it every time.  What makes him even more legit is he plays detractor's comments at the end of the show to give them their say too.  Very very cool.  He's got the cred and experience to handle your question/issue...but be ready for all of Dan's total honesty and none of the candy-coating for your fee-fees!	5	Dude nails it	Dan in Virginia

2013-09-16 10:33:48	Meh. I like Dan Savage and what he's about. But his column is just a lot tighter than the show, which rambles and gets boring quickly. I could see how young people would benefit from some of the information, though.	3	Gets repetitive	krs617
2013-08-27 12:15:47	Smart, funny, usually good advice, (sometimes) admits when he's wrong, and above all its just fun to listen to other people's problems. It's well worth it ! :)	5	Just love it	Zaorish
2013-08-26 18:37:15	$20 for twice as much Savage Love? Worth every dollar. Endless entertainment and education.	5	Magnum is so worth it!	OttaPop

2013-08-19 01:34:51	"Six podcasts define my week:  
1. Savage Lovecast, all around us!
2. Harry Shearer's Le Show, cultural and political comedy, CSUN Radio
3. The Jimmy Dore Show (political comedy, KPFK, Pacifica Radio)
4. Roy of Hollywood's rebroadcast of the Alan Watts lectures (also KPFK)
5. InnerVisions, psychology of relationships (also KPFK)
6. TTBook, To the Best of Our Knowledge, Wisconsin Public Radio

Of the six, I've listened to the Lovecast the longest, even when it was a raw, funny, and definitely different four-hour talkathon on Seattle's public radio in the early 1990s, derived from a column in The Stranger, the city's alternative paper.  Never regretted once the time.

Now SL has grown a tad into SL Magnum, a premium podcast that's almost 50% longer than what you usually hear online.  It's not a huge difference in quality or content from the regular podcast, but in this case, it's quantity as much as quality that matters.  Can't get enough of your stuff, Dan!"	5	Magnum Lovecast rules!	Robert Jacobson
2013-08-16 03:44:44	Don't think twice - it's worth every nickel.  Love you Dan !	5	Get the Magnum !	Juicenjade
2013-08-15 01:43:44	Okay, maybe that's a bit strong for a title. But I think that Dan is doing the most important work in the sex positive community. He is a very important educator and he has helped me personally very much.	5	I love Dan Savage!	Arthur2740
2013-08-14 04:51:49	"I love this podcast. I bought the magnum subscription and its worth it. I don't have to listen to commercials and I get extra questions. I will never go back. 
I love everything Dan says. I wish he was my counselor! I use so many of his sentiments in my everyday life. So often that my husband has begun to refer to him as my ""gay Jesus""."	5	Magnum is worth it!	ann197
2013-08-13 22:06:03	One of the only podcasts I listen to every single week. Dan and his callers and his guests are amazing.	5	I can't get enough. I went Magnum.	Breese8971

2013-07-01 09:22:19	"Dan Savage is the new Dr.Ruth when it comes to relationship and sex questions.  Dan has a weekly Podcast that deals with call ins from people gay, straight whatever the problem has to deal with. Dan give up front, in your face advice and is very knowledgable advice.Dan isn't new on the scene, he writes colums for newspapers but listening to his show brings life to the words and rants that he has that week. He and his husband are not just talk, they are the founders of the""It Gets Better"" project and has inspired a whole generation of practical advice and puts his advice into action. Great guest, great production, over all great top of the line Podcast. Give Dan a try of listening to him give advice to his many fans, you won't be sorry, You will return!"	4	Savage Lovecast	Drew Williams - Wright
2013-06-27 18:29:28	tough to sit through his diatribe at the beginning of each show.  As long as he is on point with his advice, I truly enjoy the podcast but can do without the political punditry.	3	Great Show but...	Digitalblue22
2013-06-18 22:52:38	Been listening for a few years. Getting sick of Dan's rants at the start of each show.	4	skip the first 5-10 minutes	Darius Jedburgh
2013-06-16 21:21:32	Sex advice with a not so subtle political agenda.  I guess if your into that kind of thing. I'm not.	2	A rant	Powticlaress
2013-06-07 01:31:45	Lots of fun and Dan's rants are legendary.	5	Great advice and very entertaining	Kevin Crossman
2013-05-30 22:18:49	Dan Savage is funny, smart, right most of the time, and great for the world. I love listening, and am thrilled that there are now longer episodes for more listening action. I would have happily paid even more for them than I did (suckers). This podcast never fails to entertain, inform, and actually help people with their lives (callers and listeners both). Thanks Dan and iTunes and everyone else involved.	5	Long time listener, first time reviewer… unless I already reviewed it, then second time reviewer	Myq Kaplan
2013-05-30 22:17:11	I'll pay but can't find the magnum versions on iTunes to sync to my iPod..	5	Magnum?	MisterJekyl
2013-05-29 17:59:40	This show entertains me thru my work day and keeps me up to date on LGBT issues. I look forward to new episodes every week and often laugh out loud during the podcast. Love you Dan!	5	There's nothing you can't ask...	candvand
2013-05-14 20:12:01	"Something tragic must have happened to the tech savy at risk youth. No podcast today?!?!!!???

Former review

Always always on time. Love it. It would not be a Tuesday without a Dan savage AM commute

Always. I hate when podcasts are not uploaded in a timely manner.  We know you guys and gals really run the show Dan is just the figurehead :)"	5	Call the cops!!!	omajay
2013-05-14 16:56:42	Dan's weekly sex and romance advice is a highlight of my weekly podcast listening, though these days I subscribe to the Magnum edition, to get even more of Dan and without any advertising.	5	Great Podcast!	I_cycle
2013-05-12 03:01:19	Dan Savage has the best sex advice for everyone gay, straight, male, female or anywhere in between.	5	Get the Magnum	Michael Critz
2013-05-08 23:57:00	The new magnum episodes are awesome	5	Great pod cast	Ziggy10123
2013-05-07 20:29:10	The Magnum version of the podcast is totally worth it.  I look forward to listening to Dan every week!	5	Love the Magnum Version!	betageek
2013-05-02 16:40:35	It is so worth the $20 to get 6 months of the longer show. This way my commute can be filled with Dan Savage. 45 minutes is not enough!	5	Love the Magnums!	MistyBrown
2013-04-27 12:16:13	Wish I could find another caster this interesting.	5	Awesome breakfast company	Vimzy
2013-05-01 04:54:11	First, Dan does not give a f-word about what anyone thinks or says about him. I am new to Dan Savage and I have to say he freely expresses his first amendment right to the absolute fullest. Dan often Blasts his critics on the pod cast, often spending the first several minutes of the show on a rant. He can sometimes seem like he has no regard for religion however, he tells it like it is in the world he lives in. There is a lot of advice on kinky, gay, fetish, and any other fifty shades of whatever you can think of. Honestly, I've had to google some of the terms discussed on the show. While I do not agree with all of the advice he gives, I learn a lot about being non apologetic and getting the absolute most out of any kind of relationship I'm in.	4	It's not for everybody	Boots916
2013-04-22 18:06:42	I really like this show. Very good insight on how people relationships really works.	5	Love it	noBody Quinn
2013-04-11 17:59:34	"Absolutely fantastic podcast. Listening to Dan has made me a more considerate and informed person in my relationships and my worldview.

I dont agree with everything he says but I love that Dan doesn't pander to anybody. To the people who call him  an egomaniac you're welcome to listen to a podcast more watered down to your exact comfort zone.

Gold star Dan. The haters is how you know it's the good stuff."	5	Dan is the man	no...no...no...YES
2013-04-21 12:41:43	He speaks of tolerance yet bashes people of faith at every chance. He is an angry hate filled man	1	Deviant profanity cast would be a better name.	scottrey
2013-04-05 22:57:22	Dan drops some good advice for the most part.	5	Good podcast	Fierce Liger
2013-04-01 23:04:51	I had no idea who Dan Savage was when I downloaded my first episode of the Lovecast. But by the time I listened to another, and another, and well, every single last episode available on iTunes, he was my favorite podcaster! Dan is always funny, angry, and insightful at just the right times. And it's no wonder because he's said himself that while he wants to help his callers, his main goal is giving us listeners a great show. My only complaint is that there are no more archives to dig through!	5	Love Love Love the Lovecast!	doublenn8
2013-03-27 02:27:31	I love your show!!!	5	SEÑOR SAVAGE Es muy bueno	Jellochabello
2013-03-20 23:41:51	This wonderful podcast has helped me in so many ways. I've gotten my friends hooked on it, too.	5	Changed my life	AddyfromE
2013-02-20 21:50:24	"I'm quoting from a show caller, but it's true. I don't practice all the acts covered in the Lovecast but I'm heartened by how often the thread reverts to ""don't be a jerk"", nurture your long-term relationships, and no one deserves ""Lesbian bed death"". And if it raises my eyebrows sometimes, I'm sure that's good exercise."	5	I didn't leave my sexuality on the delivery room floor	Spark2001
2013-03-14 13:02:05	My friends and I used to be a really big fan of this show. But it has unfortunately turned into an ego rampage where he just rants about who made him feel angry every week and has even seemed to learn how to provide insight without blindly running down an ignorant and half-thought-out tangent. I think many of us mourn what used to be a great show and hope that all the fame is worth giving up any sense of likeability.	2	bored and and disappointed	gay 20-something
2013-03-13 05:36:54	Ironic that he has become everything he hates. I Love America for allowing hate speech like this to be heard.	1	Intolerant liberal	OccupyOliveGarden
2013-02-19 03:37:59	I have loved Dan since first reading his column almost 20 years ago. He is open minded yet blunt, caring and unafraid of any question, quirk or kink. I know I represent a ton of people who learned about real sex from Savage Love- thank you!! There is a reason he has a column, podcast, tv show & speaks live all over the place, he is that good.	5	Savage fan for years	Mamina999
2013-02-15 12:49:00	I love listening to Dan give advice to his plethora of fans. He is kind and sensitive, yet abrupt when he needs to be. In such a sex negative culture, it is refreshing to hear someone talk about kink and how it is okay to be who you are.	5	Simply Amazing	Fudley05
2013-01-30 21:24:12	Or more.	5	Dan Savage for President!	KKdad
2013-01-25 13:29:46	"Heard about this podcast online, as i listened to the podcast i thought it was too crazy, weird and raunchy for me.

BUT I kept listening-so glad I did. MOST AMAZING THING EVER!!!!!!

Savage Love-cast makes any bad day good. The advice giver/host, Dan Savage, is so real, honest, blunt, open minded and accepting!! 

DAN IS FANTASTIC-BEST ADVICE GIVER I'VE EVER COME ACROSS!😃😀"	5	Best thing ever	Dani5678888888
2013-01-29 13:44:47	been listening to a few podcast and its consistent. he really has to depend on what his callers have to ask for it to be interesting vs what he himself had to say. he just sounds irritated and doesnt want to be there, and after a few episodes y should we be there to listen.	3	mixed	haiyah

2013-01-07 18:05:27	I wish I knew about this podcast earlier, although I've been listening for a couple years now.  As an American who was taught not to talk about sex, Dan Savage has single-handedly helped to dispel my ignorance.  No doubt I'm not the only one.	5	Thank you Dan Savage!	Bambasay

2012-12-08 13:55:54	I'm a 40 year old woman who just learned of Dan 1 week ago. All I can say is that I now realize just how sadly under educated I am. Or now I can say WAS! Thanks Dan! Super awesome!	5	Wow	auntbun
2012-11-18 07:36:20	Dan is amazing and is incredibly right on with his advice!	5	Fabulous!	LeahSeattle
2012-11-18 01:46:37	"As someone who majored in family studies and has studied human sexuality, marriage issues, and family dynamics, I find it very refreshing to find someone who thinks outside the box of traditional marriage/family/relationship therapy norms. Although sometimes when I hear his advice to a caller I think ""what is he thinking?! That isn't best practice at all!"" I agree with him the majority of the time, and he has helped me see alternative routes/advice that I would have never come to on my own."	5	Great podcast	Lizbot10
2012-11-05 04:50:25	By far the best podcast on the internet.  I literally ration my other podcasts to make sure that I always have some Savage Love available- I wish his column and podcast had been weekly required material in both high school and college.  It's awesome hearing someone being so crude about topics that generally don't even get discussed.  I've got a fever, and the only prescription, is more Dan Savage!	5	#1 Podcast	nchutz
2012-10-31 18:46:28	I've been listening to Dan for 3 years. His thoughts and opinions as well as the callers have changed my view on love, sex and relationships. Thanks Dan for all you do!!!	5	Life-changing	MelE1227
2012-11-01 18:56:04	I use to think I knew something, how wrong was I!  Very enlightening, thanks team Savage.	4	He stuck what where?	DJBurnham
2012-11-01 00:47:04	Without morality and with great vulgarity, Mr. Savage spews his opinions without regard to the sanctity of marriage or intimate relationships.	1	Secular	Clete2
2012-10-30 04:04:53	Great advise, an open mind and a huge heart.  I have learned much from this podcast.  Thank you for opening my eyes.	5	The Best	NomaLou
2012-10-18 20:29:56	I love Dan Savage. I have been reading him for a very long time (I won't say how long because it will prob make Dan feel old), but he has played a major part in my sexual development. As a victim of abstinence only education I can now call myself a proud ally to my best friends and brother. Thank you Dan Savage for teaching me how to love.	5	Love the lovecast	Morgatron8000
2012-10-17 23:49:37	This has nothing to do with health & fitness. Dont waste your time listing to this guy. I give him 1 star cause 0 is not an option.	1	He is horrible	Ria master

2012-08-23 20:39:23	I've learned so much about myself and expanded my acceptance as a human being because of the issues the are brought to the forefront and straightforward manner that Dan deals with them. I would recommend the podcast to anyone	5	Must experience	Sad sudoku
2012-08-15 14:13:57	Unlike some people, I'm bummed that ended up with some non-explicit episodes… not sure how. Dan is awesome. 100% right all the time? No. But who is? I don't think he would claim anything of the sort… People are SICK, and I mean that in a most appreciative way. And thankfully some of the craziest call into this show. It would get pretty boring otherwise.	5	Bring on the Cussin' and Crazy!	cyclopsed

2012-07-19 22:26:45	Dan Savage is someone who remains open and fun regarding sex advice. He is also someone who is successful in their relationship!!! yay for good advice. His advocacy against bullying and bigotry makes Dan Savage #1 on my top ten list of people I would love to meet. He speaks his mind and cares about his listeners.

2012-07-04 12:31:18	LIstening to San Savage's podcasts have made me a better person. Seriously: Due to this podcast I am more comfortable with my sexuality, I am more open-minded and accepting of people with different preferences, and I am more willing to try new things.

2012-06-16 02:59:31	I can't recommend Savage Love highly enough. Dan's approach to life will leave you feeling informed, confident and refreshingly empowered in many areas of your life despite your demographics. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll grow. This show is the total package. I tell everyone around me constantly to tune in.  And I sleep better at night knowing so many students are getting real sex ed (and life ed) from this podcast, the column and Savage U. For all this and the It Gets Better project, Dan deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. What an entertaining speech that'd be.. Thank you, Dan!!	5	Dan Savage for Nobel Peace Prize!	minkstole456

2012-06-12 22:32:14	This podcast is really great. It's def not for the judgemental, uptight snobs. I can enjoy all aspects of the show even if I can't relate to some topics, and it gives ppl an outlet so they don't feel like an outsider for having certain sexual preferences. Great job!	4	Broaden your horizon	MissLissa2323

2012-05-27 01:19:28	Foul.  This is why our morals have declined and why the people of this country, especially the youth have no manners.  I understand that this is for adults but this type of discourse takes us one step closer to making this filth mainstream.  What's wrong with being a gentalman and do we really need to air our extreme sexual needs to the public?	1	Amazing	NYK345
2012-05-22 17:07:51	"Dan Savage is brilliant, hilarious, insightful, and a honest figurehead educating his listeners on a non-puritanical approach towards sex & relationships.  Can't get enough!

Do yourself a favor and get tuned into a reality based approach to relationship ideals, crazy funny Q&A, social commentary, and awesome guests.

Dan is helping evolve humanities consciousness!  

Long live Savage Love!"	5	Yes please & thank you!	Micadova
2012-05-24 10:49:30	I like this podcast when there is more sex talk and less Dan ranting about current events. He is talking about current events I care about but I did not sign up to hear about Savage Current Events Hour. He usually rants for about 12-15 minutes and I would rather be hearing sex calls. Seems like over the years, he may be tired of answering these calls and more into grandstanding... I miss Loveline!	3	It''s okay when he actually talks about sex.	gghostryderr
2012-05-21 03:05:25	Best love advise show that I've ever heard. Dans mix of comedy and bluntness is hysterical, a must hear.	5	Great	Dusty0422
2012-05-14 05:12:00	This is one of three podcasts I adore.  Dan not only gives his listeners such gracious and honest answers to their questions, he is funnier than fun.  Thank Dan, you are very entertaiining.  Keep it up.	5	Love Savage Podcast	Eutha

2012-05-02 12:49:52	I really love this podcast, but hope that some people never find out about it. As someone who loves the idea of a traditional monogamous marriage, I think if everyone listened to Dan, monogamy would become extinct. I think even he doesn't realize the way he comes across about it sometimes. I know hetero monogamy doesn't make for an interesting or edgy show, but I almost feel like my desire to want a monogamous marriage is a kink and not the norm because of listening to Dan. I'm not sure how I feel about that...	3	Great info, strong undertones - listen with care	Benjamin Dopson
2012-04-27 01:39:09	I have been a fan for about 2 yrs now thanks to a wonderful friend that used to tell the funniest story's about this podcast. It's an informative podcast that you may not always agree with but if your closed minded and full of hate for people that can express there sexual behaviors and fetishes then its not for you. But if you want to hear great questions and sometimes (depending on how you feel about the question being asked) great advice then it's for you. I am always looking forward to the next podcast and the next set of questions that Dan is going to take on. Again LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!	5	💚💙💜❤	Shasta Gomme
2012-04-26 00:02:29	I love this podcast, and I say this as a middle-aged, republican, married-to-my high-school-sweetheart, vanilla, southern, straight lady. Timeless advice, sometimes thought provoking, always interesting and poignant, funny & fun.	5	I even love it...	Lettiebuzz
2012-04-21 05:09:39	Love this guy!  He is real and says it how it is.	5	Love you Dude!	Emdf3431
2012-04-21 18:17:00	Dan seems to me to be be intolerant of opinions, beliefs, or points of view that differ from his own. I believe that he does not have an open mind nor does he practice acceptance of diverse points of view. He does have a good sense of humor and he is entertaining. I also sense that he is searching for a higher understanding. I feel that he is entertaining but I can't get past the sometimes not so subtle condescension that he expresses.	1	Closed Minded	joecatsav

2012-04-11 18:35:31	I don't get it, I just don't feel like he's all that wise or caring, just extremely blunt and opinionated, but maybe I haven't picked the best episodes to listen to?	1	Disappointed	Anonymous 543219876
2012-04-06 18:24:21	But I've learned so much from this guy. I wish I had him when I was younger. I would have learned that my fetish was not so unusual (both of them). Keep up the good work, but please, leave Lucy home. I'm sure she is super nice, but we can't handle her.	4	I'm old.	CC Ryders
2012-03-31 15:53:45	Never a bad show! Dan Savage is fabulous! Can't wait to see his new show! ❤❤❤❤❤	5	Love!!!!	C.R.6.
2012-03-20 04:08:16	In the sex-negative society we live in, Dan's openness and candid nature is a breath of fresh air. For everyone sexually active (or wanting to be), his sensible, practical, and genius advice is a must-listen for anyone looking for frank, sex-positive conversation and advice. I especially look forward to Dan's show-starting rant. Hilarious!	5	Too important to ignore	potatomistress

2012-01-16 04:02:42	I really didn't know a whole lot about Dan before I started listening to the podcast. I jumped in and enjoyed it though. The podcast even helped to change my views on a lot of social issues, not to mention my knowledge about how to deal with certain situations.	5	Started Listening as Skeptical	Cadere
2012-01-15 01:38:59	Intelligent, non-judgemental sex advice mixed with scathing sexual politics analysis, humor, and beating down of the American Taliban.  Other sex podcasts are a joke compared to Dan.  I only wish he did more than 45 minutes a week.	5	Dan Savage is a god!	Adam Schramm

2011-12-27 20:09:22	I can only give 5, but I need ten to accurately portray the awesomeness. Dan, you are like a tsunami of change sweeping the American public- if our culture can shake the crazy attitude it has toward sex, I will attribute a huge part if that to you. Nice work with santorum, and I am honored to say I was listening when you launched the it gets better project- keep up the good work, Dan!	5	10 stars!	pirate_annie

2011-11-20 11:53:24	The first and only podcast I ever really loved. Informative, insightful, hilarious, and guaranteed to make you think about sex and relationship issues in a healthier way (although certainly not a traditional way - Dan was part of the reeducation that helped me think critically about our society's crazy ideals about relationships). I've listened to it for something like 8 hours straight while catching up on back episodes without getting bored. It has also led to great conversations about tricky issues with my boyfriend and with others. My only complaint would be that I don't get new ones more often!	5	My favorite	VUPGH

2011-08-24 03:16:38	I wish I had this information 20 years ago.  It probably would have prevented my marriage and subsequent divorce.  This podcast is very explicit and not for everyone.  I find dans political commentary LOL funny, and it is one of my favorite parts of the show- Dan, I love your rants!!!!	5	Sex Ed for adults	Lewisrotts

hooray for the latest dope to come out of the closet, woo-hoo.
C'mon, at least come up with some original material, step back and find the humor in this pathetic feel-sorry-for-me hypebole!  Nothing like taking oneself too seriously while attempting to degegrate any variances from your own down-in-the-dumps depressing thoughts, opinions and sad commentaries.
I do sincerely hope things will improve for you, so good luck and perk up."	1	SICKOS UNITED	C.P.O., Ret.

2011-07-22 19:54:26	Someone recommended this podcast to me on an atheist message board. At first I ignored the recommedation because sex has always made me a bit uncomfortable (though I've always loved porn, whether others have known it or not). I'm a straight guy that was raised Mormon and taught that sexuality is wrong, except in marriage (and even then with strict limitations), which I always found to be a mixed message. I've had little luck with women, but I'm tired of that. I'm lonely and feel socially awkward because it seems everyone else is having it but me, so I want to conquer this area of the human experience that I've been missing out on for so long. I have problems, and I'm ready to put the cognitive dissonance aside and deal with these problems head-on. I've been listening to the first few episodes of this podcast and will continue learning. Being exposed to relevant information and rational advice is helping me get past my latent guilt and bitterness towrd the opposite sex. I have some hope still.	5	Recovering psychologically	empbac

2011-05-25 20:37:34	I just discovered this podcast a couple of weeks ago and I love it! I'm starting from the very beginning and it keeps me entertained at work all day. Dan doesn't sugar coat it and tells it like it is. I wish I was able to listen to something like this growing up. It's amazing how misinformed I was about sex.	5	Wonderful podcast!	April Austin

2011-04-20 09:58:26	Dan is a clear, defiant voice in a sea of misinformation about sex.  He's critical where it counts, yet has the compassion of a mother bird watching her young spread their libidinal wings.   The world should applaud.	5	he	MoiraSaltzman
2011-03-07 02:03:19	Dan Savage gives the best sex advice. But this podcast is more than just sex advice. It's a great way to learn to keep an open mind about all your relationships: romantic and otherwise. Dan is an astute student of all human behavior and he always manages to help me think about things from a perspective different than my own. You can't get any better than that.	5	More than just sex advice	BoboPuppyhead
2011-04-10 06:26:29	Seriously, this was just what I was looking for in a podcast. I love the guests and the advice given, and it's a great addition to my line up. Always look forward to the next episode! Keep up the great work! :)	4	Just what I was looking for	piglet2000
2011-02-22 23:51:26	Dan is fantastic, he's witty and informative. Who couldn't benefit from a better sex life?	5	every adult needs this podcast.	CrayolaOne
2011-01-22 02:36:48	"I've been listening for a few months, and I LOVE this podcast.  Dan's advice is balanced, sincere, profane, and often hilarious.  There's an underlying compassion and sincerity in the way that he addresses callers which shows that, despite his curmudgeonly attitude, he really does care about helping people out, even when that means telling them flat-out how stupid they're being.  The responses to callers' questions don't pull any punches, and listeners may not always agree with his words, but Dan usually gives good advice and, even better, he does his fans the courtesy of sharing their replies and rebuttals on-air.  He doesn't bat an eyelash at even some of the most bizarre or ignorant questions, and responds to questions about unusual kinks or situations with fairness and sincerity.

The opinions expressed may not be palatable to everyone, and if you're offended by salty language or frank discussions of non-hetero, non-monogamous, non-vanilla sexual practices and relationships, this definitely isn't the show for you, but if you've got an open mind, a sense of humor, and a morbid curiosity about other people's sex lives, definitely give the Lovecast a listen."	5	There's nothing you can't ask...

2011-01-11 02:55:08	"Please address the following on a future show:

1. Now that DADT is repealed how will the military handle their transgender members? Their grooming/clothing standards are currently rigidly defined by biological sex identity.

2. Given current and past discrimination against GLB&T-Americans why shouldn't WE get affirmative action hiring and minority contracting preferences?

Now is not the time to quit being activists. We must lean forward."	5	lets work on these issues now	Ryfj

2010-11-23 09:30:38	I am writing this review because Savage crossed the line. He was filling the proverbial glass with hate for the conservative and/or traditional persons. He finally expressed his intolerance for them by adding a side car of hate once the glass had been filled. Savage, your responds are just canned answers with slight changes to each caller. Get off the soap box and educate, entertain, and make us laugh.	1	All done with Savage	Drama fan
2010-11-09 17:55:32	Reality based, honest, caring, dirty, and wonderful sex advice. I never miss an episode.	5	Best sex advice ever	PowerfulDot
2010-11-07 03:21:30	Could be a very good podcast. Very foul language all the time. Makes him sound very unintelligent. Throwing an F bomb where it fits would add some class to this podcast. Couldn't listen after a few minutes.	1	Why?	dmariehomes
2010-11-03 13:49:35	This is a podcast everyone needs to listen to. Go through them in order, out of order, backwards, sideways, whatever works for you...but just do it. It will change the way you think about sex and sexuality for the better. So open up and take a big giant piece of knowledge given by the one and only Dan Savage. You'll thank me later. Enjoy!	5	Everyone needs some Dan in their life	azimm008

2010-09-17 01:29:54	Dan always makes me feel a little more hopeful about human decency. At times I disagree with some of his advice, but at the core is his genuine desire to help people. Savage Lovecast guarantees plenty of spit-take laughter, and a dose of kind common sense.	5	Savage sanity check	newbiedoo
2010-09-29 03:12:47	"I've read Dan's column for years, listened to the podcast for 2.  I finally had it and unsubscribed today.  Dan, you need to just rename your podcast ""Dan's Gay-Rant.""  If you don't mind listening to the endless soap box rant about gay anything, this is for you.  I'm not anti-gay or anything, I just wish Dan would stick to the calls and letters like in his column.  Instead he has increasingly added more and more rant that I just can't do it any more.  Dan, dial it back a few, I can't be the only person that thinks this.  Or do whatever you want, I don't care."	1	2 year listener unsubscribes today	Fourierslaw
2010-08-30 18:51:06	Fabulous podcast, I would highly recommend it. Dan gives great advice. I love his honesty and ability to answer any question. I wish he gave advice on everything!	5	Love Dan Savage	rpar003
2010-08-23 00:00:00	Can't tell you how much I love this podcast! I have listened to each and every one of the 200 episodes. I used to download them 5 at a time to spice up a long drive (the time flew!) I also can't tell you how often I use or repeat Dan's advice. If you're offended by cursing then back the f•€k up and go listen to storycorp... I love Dan's filthy (honest) mouth and never plan to DTMFA. I just hope people keep coming up with new and exciting quandries! So stop reading podcast reviews and go muddle up some sexual disharmony!	5	Savagely in love with Dan and the Dreaded Youths	searolyn
2010-08-17 22:14:32	"If you are an open minded human and can listen to graphic, frank sexual speech, then you will love this podcast.

2010-07-27 19:32:09	"Love is the essance that spills out of Dan Savages mouth in all manor shapes, size and color. This podcast is not for the squeemish listener.  It'll make you laugh, cringe, or run for the hills and have outdoor backdoor sex.

2010-07-24 03:13:16	I love this podcast, even though I am substantially older than most of the callers. I particularly enjoy listening to each problem/issue, pausing my ipod, thinking about the question and how I would answer it, and THEN listening to Dan's response. This method has given me huge respect and admiration for Dan and how he responds to the callers/questions. He deals out humor, practical knowledge, compassion, and at times, a swift kick in the pants when necessary.	5	love it	(*v*)
2010-07-10 10:53:57	"A lot of great writers' personalities, however interesting and charismatic they are on paper, do not translate well to audio. Lucky for us, this is not the case with Dan Savage. I listened to Savage Love Live on KEXP religiously during college (in Seattle) and was really excited to find this podcast. It's truly excellent.

Dan is experienced, educated and compassionate. He offers his advice in an articulate, no-holds-barred manner that brings logic to even the most outlandish and shocking problems that callers throw at him. I think if everyone listened to this podcast, people would have better relationships, much better sex lives and become much less uptight about discussing sexuality, intimacy and even kinks.

Dan Savage had done endless amounts of good for the queer community. With the Savage Love podcast he helps a great many people work out their issues without feeling judged or attacked - whether they are straight, gay, bi, trans or somewhere over the rainbow."	5	Savage is Never Boring!	Katsgrrl

2010-06-02 02:16:02	Sometimes I may not agree with Dan Savage - he can get a little too defensive, critical, and even, at times, almost meanspirited in his answers.  But most of the time his gentle fun-poking, intelligent questions, no-nonsense approach, and wit are delightful.  I often learn from The Savage Love Podcast, not just about sex but about family, tolerance, ethics, health, history, and politics.  Dan's column is an amazing documentation of contemporary history - it gives an honest and unflinching glimpse into how a huge number of people really live.  OK, it's also hilarious, and I don't want to downplay that.  But it's intellectually stimulating and useful too.	5	I may not always agree, but I	EllizaM

2010-03-30 13:02:19	Dan Savage is not judgemental or biased. I love the whole ggg concept and the fact that he understands and values physical as well as emotional intimacy! Where was he when I was in my teens?  He was in his teens, I guess.	5	The best!!	jellyrollspice
2010-04-09 02:06:30	"This is one of the very few podcasts I look foward to downloading and enjoy listening to.

Then why do you go out of your way to point your finger?"	4	Mostly interesting...	donald-t
2010-03-28 21:25:42	Your candid advice and honesty is a fresh of breath air. Thank you Dan	5	Luvs it	Boston Mo

2010-02-09 14:43:20	I love Dan. He's wise, hysterical, no-BS, and handles sex topics in a truthful way that other advice columnists won't touch.	5	Brilliant and entertaining	pockafwye
2010-02-23 21:59:19	So this guy can judge people. There's more to life than pointing the finger and going out of your way to do so. Lame!	1	The final judge	Skyace33

2010-01-10 20:09:20	"I dither over which relationship podcast is my favorite, but usually settle on Dan Savage because of his snarky no-holds-barred (literally) attitude. I don't always agree with him, but it sure is fun to listen to him rant. This is a calls-based advice show, so it is not the place to go if you are looking for specific answers to questions of sexual health, relationships, or sexuality. However, you will learn new things, run into someone with the same problems, and laugh a lot. He co-hosts with experts on occasion, to answer more complicated medical or D/S questions. Dan is gay, and open/poly/kink friendly, so if you offend easily this is certainly not the podcast for you. I suggest the intermittent ""Speaking of Sex"" podcast from Planned Parenthood instead. I also recommend the Polyamory Weekly podcast, whether or not you are poly, for some good relationship and communication tips."	5	Listen to Dan Rant	Gail Carriger
2010-01-10 13:59:53	Dan is brilliant, and his podcast is probably the most interesting podcast you're likely to find!	5	THE MOST INTERSTING PODCAST!	Robert Schendel
2009-12-30 17:25:12	I've listened to every Lovecast since the first one. But I am NEVER listening to another one of the Dr. Barak special medical questions episodes again. It's not Dr. Barak's fault. He's a super nice guy. The questions Dan plays are so revolting on the medical episodes I don't ever want to hear one again. Episode #167 made me sick to my stomach and gave me a mental image so disgusting I would pay real cash to have it removed from my mind. Seriously. Love the Lovecast. Hate the medical gross outs. Click 'yes' if you agree.	5	Awesome ... except for the medical episodes	NewYorkTechGuy
2009-12-17 03:35:26	Gets me through my day of work, Love it!	5	Best podcast ever! 	Sharlaaqua

2009-11-04 01:08:21	Consistently great podcast.	5	Funny and informative. 	markncohen
2009-10-23 07:41:25	I find that Dan's honesty, knowledge, and level- headedness are outstanding. I admire him so much, and I cannot imagine how many sexually frustrated or scared or bullied people he has helped. I am truly blown away by his intelligence and willingness to lay down the law in a straightforward, intelligible way. I'm only fourteen, but I think that by listening to dan, I am becoming so much more sexually healthy and savvy just by hearing sex advice that isn't a load of half-arsed facts. the things that dan has taught me by answering people's questions are like a little piece of information in the future that I don't have to learn the hard way. If you are looking for a podcast that is interesting, refreshing, smart, simple, entertaining and funny as hell, I highly recommend the savage love podcast.	5	I regard dan savage as a hero.	River Tam
2009-10-27 02:31:11	Both entertaining and informative. What more could you ask of a podcast!	4	Podcast review	QueensReviewer
2009-10-21 03:00:13	"A real treat for the ears indeed. Get ready for no holes barred, in your face advice. Be prepared, as there are moments where Dan's replies to sometimes ridiculous problems which will have you screaming out loud with laughter; he has a way with words for sure!. Keep in mind however, it's no comedy show; these are serious issues we all face today .Sometimes Mr. Savage will be a special guest on Real Time with Bill Maher: Catch it if you can - because if you are on the same boat polticially, you'll be screaming ""YES!"" at many of his comments."	5	Very informative, very important and very entertaining!	JCat56
2009-10-16 03:53:51	I love this podcast it has really changed my outlook on sex, love, and relationships. Thanx	5	Boring housewife	Karmin mom of one
2009-10-07 13:08:34	This is what I love in a podcast! I want my podcast to be like Dan's when it grows up. The world needs more people like Dan - who lay it down without the BS. Excellent job!	5	Direct, blunt and beautiful	Tutivillus
2009-09-29 22:44:40	I love this podcast! I don't always agree with Dan but he gives people a point of view that they don't see themselves! definite download!	5	awesome!!	respektor
2009-09-27 08:11:08	Everyone should listen to Savage's podcast, if only to hear a voice separate from the mainstream religious and ethical perspectives on sex and relationships. Even someone very conservative would benefit from the well-developed perspective the show exhibits.	5	Important Listening for Everyone	L-Train-in-Vain
2009-09-20 07:20:51	Couldn't agree with you more, sista.	5	YES!	Errolpighedwig
2009-09-16 04:43:54	Very entertainig show, sexually and socially liberating. Dan challenges socially accepted ideas with insight and humor and upsets many people along the way. Brilliant.	5	It's GGGreat	.lime.
2009-09-09 01:42:08	Dan, call'em as you hear um. Very often right on rhe money. Thanks for the good advice show.	5	Refreshing Honesty	Voy-Ear
2009-09-08 22:52:48	I love this show...Dan is an honest, no bs kind of guy. He is also freaking hilarious...I don't miss an episode!	5	Dan Rocks!	jeanannvk
2009-09-07 19:25:15	Ignorance of those either gay or straight could educate themeselves about relationships in the treances from listening to this show . Those who dismiss and alienate others over preferences and lifestyles should look deeper through thier own life looking glass and possibly uderstand better why it is they have thier own preferences and lifestyle.	5	Good show chap	Informed now
2009-09-03 20:58:11	If more people listened to advice from Dan savage, I really think our relationships wouldn't be in as much peril as they are now. Listen to this podcast!	5	Amazing!	Philadelphia listener
2009-08-29 17:24:19	Great advice (regardless of your sexual orientation), intelligent, caring, funny host.	5	Dan is awesome	mbh9700
2009-08-25 02:26:25	I am embarressed to admit that I listen to Dan and Dr. Laura. Hmmm.	5	Love him	Belowe
2009-08-22 02:44:19	Great show, great advice, why are u reading this instead of listening????!!!! GO DAN!!!!!	5	The best podcast	PoetWill
2009-08-23 08:25:04	I like the idea and format of the podcast, but find myself cringing everytime Dan uses offensive and explicit words, especially when he doesn't need to. I'm not referring to sexually explicit language at all, but instead refer to the slurs he uses to describe gays, lesbians, and any other group he non-chalantly insults. We don't need adults modeling this anti-gay (ironically enough) language for children who already are exposed to it in their schools by other children. The fact that Dan is gay doesn't excuse his use of anti-gay slurs, especially becuase those who hear the words aren't always aware of that fact. It's hard enough fighting rampant homophobia in schools without adults modeling the behavior; we just don't need to hear it. Aside from that, the podcast is perfect.	4	Good. Could Be Cleaner.	Jaric55
2009-08-16 13:52:05	I have learned so much from listening to this podcast. Mostly about things I didn't even know about, kinks, fantasies, peoples thoughts and sometimes just how dumb people are. I downloaded 3 to start with to see if I would like it and now I have all of them on my ipod. He has really down to earth advice no matter how crazy of a question you ask without making the caller feel stupid. I agree with his advice about 99.5 percent of the time. I LOVE Dan and I am learning to be GGG! Listen and you'll get it.	5	I feel smarter and dumber	antonietteh
2009-08-13 15:21:59	I have read Dan's syndicated column since 1996 but the Savage Lovecast adds a new dimension to it. It shows a more humorous side but also it shows that Dan cares a lot about anyone's suffering, that human side was new to me. You don't have to agree with Dan on everything to enjoy this podcast. Great insights on health, human relations and sometimes funny as hell.	5	Better than the column	Sergio Parreiras
2009-08-06 03:13:28	Love the lovecast; utterly addictive, funny, thought-provoking & irreverent.	5	Luv u Dan!	Rula_Lenska
2009-08-03 14:35:21	the savage lovecast is the best podcast ever, i love dan and the tech saavy at risk youth. they are really helping people, including me! Thank you dan savage, keep it up!!	5	I Love Dan Savage!	love_like_winter
2009-07-27 05:09:50	A friend recommended this podcast to me several weeks ago. It's educational, entertaining and needed in our repressed society.	5	Edgy, Funny, Real and NEEDED!	BD081098
2009-07-21 16:48:28	"Dan Savages show is as entertaining as it is informative. No matter how odd the question or kink he doles out great advice. He's not afraid to bring out an ""expert"" to give him a hand. He's not always perfect, but he is always a hoot."	5	One of the Best	CoastalSatyr
2009-07-20 22:52:22	"Only two things you need to know. (1st) This podcast has ben rated over 225 times and almost 200 of them are 5 stars. (2nd) There is NOTHING you can't ask on the Savage Lovecast. If you can be open to handeling the ""nothing"" part, and realize not all sex is vanilla, then I think you will enjoy this podcast."	5	Two things...	coreycorey
2009-07-18 20:33:53	I've been a long-time Dan Savage fan, having listened to his call-in show long ago and been an avid column reader for many years. His podcast is just like an audio version of his column, so if you like the column you'll love the podcast. He's funny, crass, intelligent, profane, compassionate, and oftentimes necessarily harsh. He tells people what they need to hear, and he educates with humor, facts, and just damn good, sensible advice. He'll bring in various experts to field questions he doesn't feel he can do justice to, and has occasionally thrown out a question to the listeners. If you want to learn about sex, relationships, family, friends, toys, kinks, or just something new about sweaty, humping humans, download this podcast! If you are easily offended, can't stomach discussions of dirty, dirty sex, are abstaining from sex for religious reasons, or are a typical sexually stunted, tightly-wound American priss when it comes to anything and all sexual, you REALLY need to download this podcast! One downside is that the quality of the recorded calls varies widely, and sometimes they are very hard to understand. I'm no audio engineer so I don't know if anything can be done about that, but 75% of the time it's easy to understand the caller. The rest of the time fiddle with the volume and you'll get it.	5	Five stars for content, 4 for technical aspects	pandapuffs
2009-07-18 18:57:26	I've been reading Dans column for quite a while and am now a loyal listener. His no BS responses and his candidness are so refreshing. If I ever need relationship/sex advice, he'll be the first one I call.	5	Funny and helpful	vjs829
2009-07-15 06:56:20	He's entertaining, dogmatic and a wonderful advocate for what's important in the gay community.  Honest and funny his voice is one to be celebrated.  A true force to be reckoned with.	5	No one does me like Dan does	Fivecupcake
2009-07-17 20:16:28	"I listened to 4 random sampling for the first time today. Of the 4, in 3 of them, you tell people its okay, and perhaps even desirable, to lie to their parents about some problem. In the 4th, you advocated lying about whatever to someone else. ""Hi, I'm 21. My parents say if I keep dating a 45 year old, they'll cut me off financially and stop paying for college."" Savage response: ""This is one of those times you really need to lie to your parents about this"". Well done. You told a 21 year old to risk college over a 45 year old guy who opens the door for her, sends her flowers and is probably good in bed."	1	What a waste of time	HoomanB
2009-07-13 01:45:57	Dan is amazing and this show is my favorite. Very entertaining and informative.	5	The Best!	Marrrk
2009-07-03 21:18:27	a must listen... love it to the max	5	Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	naibsel7828
2009-06-30 03:18:01	You know the one thing that impeesses me about Dan is his honesty! In a world where most people question themselves and how they feel, Dan makes it ok. Relationships & sexuality are difficult, period. He cuts through all the confusing, conflicting emotions that makes us ambivilent. Thanks Dan for helping us see that the truth is ok, even if it is not popular with those around us...	5	Great Show !!!	FinalApproach
2009-06-26 18:59:39	In a world where the BS of PC rules everything, Dan Savage is a breath of fresh air. Listening to his Podcast makes my day. There's no beating around the bush here, people. If you can't handle hearing the truth, don't listen.Thanks, Dan. You're my hero.	5	Honest answers - even if it hurts	jamiezane
2009-06-11 16:22:55	I've been a reader for many years and now I don't miss a podcast. Dan has helped me communicate more effectively with my wife toward positive outcomes. Listening to his podcast helps me understand more what is means to be sex positive while living in a remote, conservative, Christian dominated outpost. As a world-class pottymouth myself, I appreciate Dan's salty language and style. Thanks Dan for contributing to my happiness.	5	Dan Savage has helped my marriage.	I don't want another stupid nickname or screen name!!!!!
2009-06-06 03:04:49	It's honest and blunt which I appreciate. It covers diverse groups of people/interests which makes it even more interesting to hear and, at the same time, I'm getting great information which may or may not apply to my own situations/interests. Good stuff. Can't get enough.	5	My new favorite.	Nebrmom
2009-06-10 01:58:35	"I've been a fan for years, but I just cancelled my subscription to this podcast. Why? Because in a recent podcast he adviced a woman who missed her dog (the dog was now with her ex-husband), and Mr. Savage recommended that she simply get a new dog. I'm not disappointed because I'm a ""dog person,"" but I'm disappointed in his reply to someone who in turn critiqued his advice. In short, Mr. Savage said that he doesn't like dogs, and he don't understand or doesn't know anything about dogs (I forget his exact words, but they were to that effect), and thus his previous advice stands. THAT's what turned me off, the fact that he gives an opinion or advice on something he doesn't kow anything about. Now he's no different from other blowhards on radio and podcast-land. I wish he sticks to sex and relationship advice in the future. THAT's what he knows. Writing about dogs (or whatever) without knowing anything about the subject is no different from every other loud mouth out there. It's not funny, it's not amusing, and it's not informative. Why am I listening? I don't waste my time listening to people give off opinions on subjects they admit they know nothing about. A pity. I thought he was funny, and a genius. He's crossed a line I personally don't want to see crossed. Best of luck to Mr. Savage and his listeners. Thanks for the memories."	3	disappointed	P.S.A.
2009-05-28 11:44:44	As a Catholic and a sex-positive person, I love Dan's blend of raunch and morality. He is a tender sould with a dirty mouth, what a great podcast. I NEVER miss it!	5	Dan Rocks	Charlotte1011
2009-05-18 04:20:09	Whether you're straight or gay, young or old, smart or stupid, Dan Savage tells his listeners, not what they want to hear, but what they NEED to hear. Often tongue-in-cheek (no pun intended), I highly recommend this podcast.	5	Honest, straightforward (no pun intended), and amazingly insightful	Moragami0
2009-05-08 07:16:08	Thank you Dan!	5	The best advice for loving yourself and others.	WrightStick
2009-05-04 22:27:49	This podcast is a no hold barred discussion about all those things people are usually afriad to talk about. Dan does not hold back, and does not censor or dumb down what he has to say. This is raw, direct, and insightful. I love listening every week. I saw Dan Savage on This American Life live the other week and I was deepy touched by his story. Dan, you were awesome.	5	Entertaining and Eye Opening	RenX99
2009-05-07 02:12:50	Advice from America's favorite sex columnist. He doesn't judge and answers calls and e-mails personally. If you're close-minded or easily offended, look elsewhere. Quirky, funny, and frequently profane.	4	Savage Love from Dan is always good!	JD in MSP
2009-04-08 23:15:25	Dan is amazing! I love this podcast. It is real and it is educational. If I could only listen to one podcast for the rest of my life, this would be it. Great job and I look forward to future casts. Thank you.	5	Yes he can!	Medangel
2008-12-16 02:53:23	I truly love this podcast. I have downloaded every available one! I listen in the car, at the gym, anytime I can get away with it. Thanks and keep em' comin!	5	I am hooked!!	atlspyderboy
2008-11-12 17:00:47	I listened to all 107 podcasts in the course of three weeks and it didn't even make me horny. If this show can dispell the smallest amount of sexual ignorance and purdishness we have in this country, then maybe we can all finally get good and laid. Savage Love is a drug.	5	Preach It.	fanclub23
2008-11-11 23:19:15	"""Our attempt to ruin mathmatics..."" lol, luv ya Dan."	5	Best podcast ever	spoonFed
2008-11-06 21:43:57	While Dan is a somewhat rude individual at times, he promotes an open communication model for relationships & a realistic look at human sexuality. This is a worthwhile podcast for all (19 & up).	5	A must for anyone 18 & up	Quigza
2008-11-01 23:42:57	Dan Savage is probably my most favorite (only?) advice columnist, and this podcast adds another way I can get my fix.  I find his advice to be mostly on the mark, and applicable to people of many walks of life.  His unflinching acceptance of people and their weirdness & kinks is refreshing.  I'm not average and I'm a far cry from normal; any advice you're sending my way should be, as well.	5	Great show, witty host	Lebkin
2008-09-27 21:32:23	This podcast is phenomenal. Thank you Dan for your work, putting this together and giving out information and point of views most people dont think about. Great resource for any human with a pulse. 	5	awesome! 	andes200
2008-10-14 22:35:07	Love Dan Savage, but it is time to upgrade the audio -sounds like it was recorded in a phone booth...	3	Lose the echo!	Joe&Bill

2008-09-13 19:07:36	Long time listener, first time reviewer...  Dan Savage is a genius. I have read his column for years and was pleasantly surprised to find this podcast. It features the same irreverent humor, but it is always backed up with sound advice. 	5	Sexy show for sexy people.	javamonkey111
2008-09-05 05:00:09	modern, insightful, funny, REAL. I love this podcast!	5	amazing!	lolabalola
2008-08-22 13:46:40	"I expected that this podcast would have sexual content....duh. I didn't expect that it would be filled with advice to lie to other people to cover your tracks. Own your behavior----if you can't admit to it then you probably shouldn't be doing it.This podcast is another ""do what you feel like doing and justify it later"" piece of junk."	1	Values: Missing in Action	Zaphod420000
2008-07-30 09:41:04	his honest, caring, and quirky way of answering questions has made his column and the savage lovecast enjoyable to read and listen to. love him or hate him, you can't deny that he really knows what he's talking about and he seems to love what he does.	5	thanks, dan!	luciasaurus
2008-07-23 23:33:21	This guy is very much at home in the darker corners of your bedroom, but doesn't just mug for shock value.  Solid advice for all kinds.	5	Terrifically wise potty-mouth	Pletched
2008-07-16 04:09:37	There is truly no question you can't ask on this podcast.  I love that Dan calls people out on their stupidity, but he also supports people who need it.  Dan Savage is the perfect mix of compassion and @$$holery.  His podcast is fun, interesting, and always entertaining.	5	Good advice and entertaining	HotInTheCity
2008-06-14 12:50:06	In my opinion one of the best shows out there. If more people would adopt the rules of Love and relationships the Mr. Savage promotes...the world would be such a less complicated place. Give this show a chance...it has the power to change your life.	5	Great show	greenman76
2008-07-06 08:44:33	This fool has a dirty mouth. inexperienced in my book.	1	inexperienced 	Da'Vi
2008-06-02 23:08:15	Dan Savage is a great print writer as evidenced by his memoir and political books and his weekly sex column, but who knew the man was just as good off the cuff? Dan is funny, romantic, and honest, the knowledgable friend that every person wants to go be able to go to whether your signifigant other just introduced you to a fetish you've never heard of or you're worried about an old flame. Even better, Dan is entertaining and educational no matter what the context, our modern day Oscar Wilde. Savage Love rocks!	5	Intelligent, witty, and arguably almost always right	opheliaawake
2008-05-23 06:30:59	Dan,    You are inspirational, I love your podcast. You are a straight shooter, and you advise all people, gay or straight, and bring up important issues to each. You are so informative, Love your podcast!!!!!. You are an inspiration. Thank you for your podcast. 	5	Love it! keep it going!!!	horseridinggirl

2008-05-11 00:11:51	I love the Savage Love column.  Unfortunately, Dan comes off as a whiny b**h on the headphones.  I'll keep reading his words but I can't stand listening to his voice.	1	Whiny	Older Than You

2008-03-28 01:34:43	"Dan's advice is usually good. I enjoyed his book and hear his column is good - though I'm not a reader. His podcast would be better if he wasn't trying to earn street cred with all of the foul language.Really, I haven't heard anyone use the term ""motherf**r"" since the 1970s. Snap out of it Dan, save the F-bombs for when you're actually talking about sex."	2	Does he kiss his mother with that mouth?	sfimporter
2008-02-15 18:28:48	Dan Savage is my hero! Don't tell him though, he's a good catholic boy who hates it when people say nice things about him. Seriously get the podcast it's amazing	5	the best on itunes	ridr90
2008-03-11 13:20:33	Beyond politically incorrect (but that's what he's striving for, right?), and much blunter than Sue Johansen; always informative and entertaining.  I'd carry his same-sex love child on the strength of this podcast alone.	4	it's the real deal	GranDiva
2008-02-01 08:28:47	Omg I don't like many podcasts, but I love Dan. The fact that he is so frank and honest... I just listen to him on the bus and drown out all the BS every morning...It's great stimulating audio. It really makes you think what would you do if you were in these people's situations...Download this column! I have learned so many things through Dan and the experiences of others! :D	5	This is the best podcast EVER!	Red Noir
2008-01-07 06:43:09	Usually humorous and always insightful, Dan's podcast is just as witty, informative, and all-around great as his written column! I've never written or called in, but I've learned a lot over the years. Thank you so much, Dan!	5	"""Dear Abby"" for real people"	Ni Tsu J
2008-01-06 09:15:51	"Savage's ""out loud"" version of his weekly column with his trademark, down to earth cold, wet slap of reality.  Very funny stuff.  Always informative.  If you want sex advice that doesn't neuter itself trying to be nice, Savage is your man."	5	Have problems?  You bet you do	russellfrost
2008-01-03 21:29:13	This podcast has taught me so much, and I know I am a better husband for listening and learning. Dan is straight to the point, no bull, with superb advice for all. Thanks Dan.	5	Wonderful	RealityhasLiberalBias
2007-12-31 23:06:30	I started reading Savage Love in the Chicago Reader about a year ago and then I stopped going down to Chicago, so I stopped reading his stuff. After having seen him in a special with Sue Johanson, I went online and looked up his articles and came across this podcast. It's wonderful! I may be over a year late, but I'm practically half way done listening to all of his stuff up to date and I've only been listening for the past two days. His witty and carefree attitude is wonderful for anyone who is willing to hear a man tell people exactly what they need to hear.	5	Absolutely Wonderful!	Sal E
2007-12-12 18:50:10	I've been reading Savage Love in the Village Voice and The Stranger since I was 12 (I'm 22 now) and he has helped me so much over the decade. I've been listening to this podcast since the first one came out and for everyone that hasn't, you should! He has amazing advice, great wisdom, he's funny as hell, and he's brutally honest which I totally love. Everyone with developed sexuality and a sense of humor will enjoy this podcast.	5	Longtime reader loves listening too!	melekaliki
2007-11-26 22:15:47	I discovered Dan through features on This American Life.  Like other reviewers, I am nearly always in agreement with the advice that he gives.  But the most refreshing and entertaining part of his show is that he freely admits to being biased and flawed.  It makes him eminently human and relatable.  And he has kind of a sexy voice to boot.	5	Cutting Through Hypocrisy	John from Manhattan
2007-11-07 04:21:05	I look forward to this every week.  I wish he had more than one.  It's wonderful!  He's got amazing family values, but he's certainly no prude.  I adore Dan Savage.	5	Savage Joy	Teacher01607
2007-11-15 18:43:08	decent show but, ATTN all podcasters.  DON'T eat food or chocolate or candy during a podcast.  It's discusting to listen to you chew and slosh your food into the Mic.  ok, getting off the soapbox.. 	3	uggh....	Draven77
2007-10-29 23:28:17	Dan makes my week.  Funny, sexy, and informative.	5	Awesome.	Orkspace
2007-10-28 02:46:34	Savage's show is hip, frank and informative with a no-holds barred style.  He blows Dr Drewout of the water!  I love this show!...and FU! DR LAURA!	5	STRAIGHT UP SEX ADVICE WITH A PUNCH!	EG NYC
2007-10-19 08:50:40	Dan is amazing with any questions/concerns you need him to respond to. He's as honest as anyone will ever be when you need someone to tell you what you need to hear.	5	Amazing!	NesGCubeFreak
2007-10-11 15:39:15	Dan tells it straight to the straights or gays asking sex advise.  His strong opinions on gay rights, children, and fair treatment in relationships come through in his unsensored speech.  Intelligent and helpful, he wants you to fully explore your sexuality (healthly).  Dan Savage is the author of The Commitment and The Kid: What happened when my boyfriend and I decided to get pregnant. 	5	Always Funny, Always Entertaining	SMPlease
2007-04-19 02:53:08	I have been reading Dan Savage's column at the Village Voice for the past 5 years or so.  I enjoy reading because he gets straight to the point without trying to paint a pretty picture.  I was glad to see that there is a podcast.  I have listened to 2 episodes and greatly enjoyed it.  One of the questions he answered was a topic of conversation I recently had with a couple of friends, which cleared up many things.  Highly recommend though its sometimes (rarely) hard to make out what the caller says.	5	The One and Only Dan Savage	NoKa
2007-03-09 22:59:53	I'm sure that there's more professional podcasting out there, but Dan Savage is a man who cares about Americas' sex life, and he tells it like it really is. Not to be missed. (And if you're sensitive about adult language, just listen to a few episodes and you'll be all better.)	5	All the answers you were afraid to get. Out loud.	Daddy-Oh
2007-04-17 22:25:50	Just when his long -winded raunchy monologues start becoming annoying white noise ... HUP ... Mr. Savage actually says something insightful and sensitive and smart.  That’s the moment I’m glad I listened.  I know that being “too cool for this world” brings in a lot of readers and listeners...but Dan, your listeners are not only sexually inquisitive but also more erudite that you imagine.  So dazzle us with your brain and expand your vocabulary past the F words.	4	Look for the kernels of wisdom	Herbal Diva 
2007-01-12 03:55:09	Dan is very real, and VERY straight-forward.  A true gift these days.  	5	Refreshingly honest	shadowweaver
2006-12-28 08:29:59	I am a new reader of his column and even newer to his podcasts, but I am hooked!!  I love the fact that he is direct and to the point, but there is always a humor to his responses.  Too many people forget his advice is only an opinion, and take too much of what he says personally. Only problem with the podcast is that the callers are sometimes hard to hear, but he can't control the phones that people call from.  I just can't get enough, keep up the good work Dan!!  	5	I love Dan	Ms. QT Pie
2006-12-28 08:14:22	I LOVE YOU DAN SAVAGE! YOU ARE AMAZING!	5	HEY DAN!	11Rich11
2006-12-22 14:54:43	Dan Savage has really got the hang of the podcast format and the show is now running smoothly. This is well worth a subscription for Savage's brutally honest and sexually explicit advice. Don't listen to the negative reviews! If you love his column, you'll love this. Perhaps even more so.	5	A Great Weekly Fix	sugarmoop
2006-11-15 18:39:31	I'm a huge fan of the column and now I'm a huge fan of the podcast. Dan is entertaining and educational. Love it!	5	Love It	snowboarderchica
2006-12-03 19:08:10	"Sure it's underproduced - it's a PODCAST.  And speaking of pod (no, let's not go there ...)  I have always been a fan of Dan's voice and his work on ""This American Life"" and I find his online advice column big fun.  But what was up with the balloon noises in the Thanksgiving episode?"	4	Rough but fun ... like the man himself.	Pengo
2006-11-22 05:54:46	It's nice to see that Dan Savage is doing a podcast.  Many years ago, he did a call-in radio program on KCMU (now KEXP) in Seattle called Savage Love Live.  It was the funniest, experimental and informative hour of radio you could listen to late on a Sunday night.  So, give him some time to find his feet in this format.  At least you count on him to provide you with direct, honest, fair and insightful advice and information.	4	Welcome back to audio.	criscoshoes
2006-11-03 16:22:29	Love The Stranger's column that's slung across this great nation like custard at a clown convention. Can't WAIT to listen to Dan Savage's broadcast. Only question: husky baritone or  mickey mouse squeek? Guess we'll see. And, Dan, you BEST be working on articles, podcasts, even an independent film concerning Rick Santorum's looming demise. C'mon, don't let us down!	5	Love column, marry podcast?	Jefe001
2006-11-15 09:33:52	I'll take as much Savage Love as I can get, whether it's in print or podcast...He always tries to be as honest as possible and that naturally feeds into his experience in this new endeavor.  I appreciate it and enjoy hearing him even when he's unsure of the process himself.I think the only drawback is not being able to edit the questioners so that they are more succinct like one can in print.Otherwise, it's great that I can now get a little more Love each week and I don't have to be glued to the text of the paper or screen.  	4	Gimme!	mhnek
2006-11-04 05:41:56	Pros: - same sort of entertaining questions and advice you'd expect if you're a fan of the column- Savage has radio experience, and is not painful to listen to, unlike the majority of novice podcastersCons: - it's sometimes very difficult to understand the callers, as the sound quality of the calls can be very badI've been a fan of his column for 10 years, and after listening to the first two episodes, I'd say this is a very promising podcast. I'll keep listening.	4	give him some time, he'll get better	Joe Tank
2006-11-03 03:01:31	Second show not any better than the first--feels slapped together, and Dan just doesn't have much personality in this format.  His appearances on This American Life are so much better, but I suspect that must be editing and music.  	1	Kinda Half-Assed	Man of the Desert
2006-10-25 12:34:33	I've been reading Savage Love (the advice column) since...let's see, 1996. Ten years, wow.  Anyway, in that time I've come to greatly admire Dan Savage's sexual advice.  I've disagreed maybe a handful of times, but overall it has been frank, funny, and accurate, and served many people well.  His language may be a bit shocking at first, but don't let that put you off-- it's just a way of approaching people's-- sometimes poignant, often bizarre-- dilemmas head-on with absolute honesty.  The first podcast is a bit rocky (and in my opinion, too short), but I'm sure it will improve.  You can call and leave questions for Dan to answer at 206-201-2720, and it's entirely anonymous if you want it to be.	5	What a great idea!	Rillion
2006-11-01 04:03:14	Lots of potential, but I think rather than just diving into questions, there needs to be some intro, maybe some current event in kinky sex and drugs or a quick monologue, i dont know im not the guy doing the podcast. But there needs to be a smoother introduction. A sidekick wouldn't hurt either, maybe bring in David Shmader or something, just to keep the show flowing and upbeat. Oh, I almost forgot: Have your techie kids add chapters to your podcast, so we can jump to specific topics.Love the colum,Brandon H	3	Potential	Brandon2084
2011-03-17 16:38:06	"this Dan Savage has got nothing to do with the Savage Japan podcast and if you would have taken a minute to listen you would have known that yourself!!!!

Dan is da man."	5	Oi you idiot underneath,	Memeee
2010-12-20 01:47:04	I am so glad I found the podcast. It has helped me understand so much about human sexuality and how to tolerate other's desires. I love how Dan will throw in politics and current events along with his advice. It makes this so much more than just a sex advice podcast. I admit, I totally have a rather inappropriate crush on Mr. Dan Savage.	5	Absolutely amazing	Aregbug
2011-04-10 05:47:11	He's made me feel more comfortable in my own skin. Thanks Dan!	5	Helpful	walkman001
2011-04-02 02:17:17	Should be required listening for all.	5	Brilliant	A horse named Ed
2011-03-15 12:41:56	Great sex & relationship advice	5	Great	ResCogitans
2011-03-09 01:26:07	Ever since a friend of mine opened my eyes to Dan Savage I've been addicted to him and this podcast! If there was anything I could ask more of it would be to have more kink themed podcasts. Thanks Dan!	5	Addicted!	Lauren McKay
2011-01-18 15:56:29	Someone is slacking on getting the show up on iTunes early Tuesday morning like they used to. It happened last week, and I thought that maybe it was an isolated incident, but the same thing happened today. I look forward to getting my savage love fix on Tuesday mornings while driving to work... Help me out, here.	5	Love the show, but...	RabidLiger
2011-03-17 04:55:48	Take a break from this podcast and submit the podcast you have promised for your Japan podcast already!  Seeing how many you have done for this podcast only upsets me more for believing your promises!	1	Finish your other podcast!	TokyoTigers06
2015-10-17 12:49:34	Every Tuesday I look forward to getting the podcast!!!	5	Witty, incisive, always interesting	Guru'Guay
